I cannot continue to debate someone who has no real argument besides “capitalism is good because I like it. I can’t see anyone suffering because of it so therefor no one does.” That’s not an argument and is a abysmal foundation for any sort of world view.

I chose the wrong guy, not because you managed to escape a fundamentalist cult (good for you by the way! I also had to make a painful break from my fundamentalist family to begin my journey through life. No sarcasm, seriously good for you) but because you have made up your mind to remain oblivious and nothing I can say will change that. \n",

      "> Libel: In the US, if someone accuses you of lying about them in print and sues you, they need to prove that what you said was false. UK libel law reverses the burden of proof: when suing someone for libel, it’s up to the defendant to prove that what they said was true. More specifically, to win a libel case in the UK, the plaintiff only needs to demonstrate that the statement hurt their reputation; unlike in most situations in the US, they don’t also need to prove that the statement was false. A UK defendant can, of course, mount a defense that “it was true,” which is helpful if they can prove it.\n",

And, like I said, Musk probably did come up with a few things and do a few things, like any smart individual did. But the reason that you are hearing about Musk all the time and not his lead scientist or designer who probably did way more meaningful work as individuals, not to meantion all of the other scientists and designers, is that he has the money, not because he is actually overflowing with new ideas. The media just gives you the impression that he is because that is who the media is focusing on. Because most media outlets are the lapdogs of the powerful.\n",
