So a conversion will have to take place the where and how that happens is also interesting. I assume they are going to do a man in the middle SSL / TCP  handshake and allow a server / firewall device to bundle up traffic and burst it back to you.

Also Elon needs to ease up a bit on his timeline predictions, haha.\n",

I remember reading the initial blog post on the Roaster -> Model S -> Model 3 strategy, what like 10+ years ago? He also hit home runs on his only attempts at his previous companies, and ratchets up the difficulty an order of magnitude every time. He has the ability to see through the bullshit to the essence of problems and come up with good solutions, which is super rare (and timelines fall into that bullshit category).\n",

The Nissan Leaf had poor 0-60 (8 seconds), poor range (\\~80 miles), was small, and was not a design that lined up against, say, a high end Mercedes. The Model S blew all those categories out of the water.

It doesn’t really matter that the timelines and price don’t match the guess, because the overall results are not only amazing but gamechanging, but it’s just about putting it in perspective.

      "Which Musk has said these satellites can also be repurposed for — cleaning up debris.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The Leaf is not making the case that Tesla made for electric cars. The initial mass market version had pitiful range and low overall performance. Plus it looked like a toy. That was the entire perception of electric cars in the market, that they were slightly improved golf cars and not to be taken seriously. Tesla changed that. Period.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------\n",

Also, as Elon said, Tesla merely sped up the advent of electric cars, which was also the mission of the company. A lot of people get that confused and think that Tesla’s mission ought to be that they should have 100% market share or something like that.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "What's the waste in this case? I would argue that it's a better use of the same amount of money to get a Tesla which has longer range than say a car at a somewhat similar price but with half the range.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're concerned about the locked range, probably people will just pay to unlock it later. And those who don't, don't need it anyway. The battery might last longer that way, or be able to go on to later use like powering a house.  \n",
      "\n",

      "Also strategically it’s a lot easier and more reliable to follow the leader.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "When BO was formed, there was no example of SpaceX. The examples were completely opposite, actually. Private enterprises founded by rich guys had spectacularly failed and lost a lot of money. Governments had partially succeeded after a vast amount of money and time. The scale of the problem seemed impossible to overcome. So it made sense to take a slow and steady approach, so even if the problem wasn't solvable within Bezos' lifespan, there would still be progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then SpaceX burst onto the scene, first ridiculous and now revolutionary. The game is now changed. We are now in a post-SpaceX world, and I don't know that BO has updated their strategy in response. To some degree, I think the old guard is in denial about the realities of this new world of rocketry, even now, and that includes some BO employees and perhaps even Bezos himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other main factor is that BO has a guaranteed source of funding, while SpaceX does not. Survival is tremendously motivating. It's possible that Bezos—an extremely sharp guy—knows that BO won't have that survival pressure and has concluded that this is the best alternative. Also, SpaceX's progress may not be possible by effectively anyone other than Musk. BO’s strategy does not require someone like Musk and in that sense has less risk.\n",

      "The subsidies should be for electric vehicles period. I could see them reducing at a higher threshold, say $100k. But then again if a company wants to make like a 2000km range car for some reason then those consumers shouldn’t be cut out.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the intention is to prevent subsidizing the already rich, then maybe they could set the threshold at a luxury vehicle although that might be hard to define and enforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "This $45k threshold by the Canadian govt is stupid because it doesn’t even capture the current flagship electric car, the Model 3, and what will be the co-flagship, the Model Y. Nor does it capture some of the upcoming releases by bigger manufacturers, and competition by them is what will really accelerate things.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in general I’m also fine with subsidizing the Model S and X. In fact I think there should be MORE electric car subsidies, not less. (As an aside, in general I also think Elon should get MORE support and encouragement, not less, as many seem to think.) But, if I had to come up with some kind of compromise for some stupid reason (i.e. right wing anti-climate change pressure), then the bar should be higher at the very least.\n",
      "\n",
      "The policy itself will be less effective and see less usage than if the bar were set higher. However it also introduces some interesting constraints. I don’t think the Canadian market is big enough to matter, but worldwide it would be interesting. As raw costs like batteries came down, it would make for some interesting “pack everything you can into $45k” outcomes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I don’t think the situation is about range. It’s about political pressure around certain brands, and some healthy ignorance about the current pricing in general. Arguing range is not the way out of it. \n",
