I'm proud of Elon Musk for finally growing (somewhat of) a fucking spine and saying something. A previous commenter has a point about it maybe being worth the trump stink to stick around so you can block his worst decisions from happening, but then again, I also see the damage from it just legitimizing Trump's decisions.

Possibly, but their competitors in the reusability market are a long way off.

So when they hire they specify that they want the most hardcore mofos of their fields. The downside is that you're expected to work hard for average pay. The upside is that you will be allowed to do something meaningful and can actually help progress towards a real goal.

They are VERY VERY upfront about this. Most employees get what they signed up for. A few do not.

SpaceX and Tesla are both fighting industries that have sat on their asses for years. Literally. You could be in Boeing as an engineer, and design nothing that is ever built for YEARS. If you enjoyed this no pressure, 9-5 scenario ... and you switch to SpaceX, be prepared to fucking HATE it. On the otherhand, if you are ambitious, pick SpaceX and **even as an intern**, your ideas might make it into orbit within the year. That's a huge deal for some people.

Turnover isn't particularly high. Many employees though, plan to do SpaceX for 2 years for something sick to put on their resume, and then when they settle down with kids, move to Lockheed so that they can have a better work-life balance.

Employee satisfaction in the company is incredibly high though. I see no problem with it being a resume check mark. Would you say being a student is terrible because few people stay longer than 4 yrs and people do it for their resume?

I've personally spoken to dozens of SpaceX employees and they are on the whole super happy working for SpaceX. The ""general consensus"" is that SpaceX makes you work hard... but at the end of the day you've actually done something meaningful, and that is worth it to these guys.

It is a personal preference.

If they weren't being paid enough money, why would they work there? It doesn't make any sense at all. These are TOP level engineers that could pick any job they wanted. They fought to get into SpaceX. Clearly it is worth it to them.

I generally think no one should give Trump any cover or credibility by trying to ""advise"" him on things like this when it's been clear for at least a decade that he's never going to listen to anyone intelligent anyway and is a lying idiotic con artist. 

However with Musk in particular, I've considered that he has a better excuse than most to at least try. SpaceX requires federal permission to do basically anything and will rely on federal contracts to exist. Trump is a thin skin vindictive psychopath. If Musk came out hard against Trump he'd risk having a huge amount of progress and work on SpaceX being completely blocked because that's exactly the kind of shitty thing Trump would do. I want SpaceX to keep developing and obviously Musk cares deeply about it, and I could see that justifying trying to be a person who does their best to gently explain things to Trump even if they'll be ignored. It's the cost of trying to keep SpaceX operational in the United States, and it seems like Musk is deciding leaving the Paris accords would be a breaking point for him where he'd take that risk.

Pretty much Trump sees the faked magazine, and he believes it. If you do not feel like looking for it in the article, the reason why people were saying Global cooling in the 1970's is because skeptics like to exaggerate the few scientific paper predictions from the 1960's-1970's of global cooling, when a majority of them predicted global warming. And for those who did predict global cooling, it was because they predicted aerosol levels in the atmosphere would rise due to it being a product of air pollution, and since aerosol deflects sunlight into the atmosphere, they predicted a cooling Earth. Ultimately, the aerosol levels did not increase because of agreements such as the Clean Air Act reduced human air pollution, and thus also aerosol emissions, so the cooling did not happen. Now, it is all about greenhouse gas emissions and carbon dioxide and warming.

>Because Tesla has only managed to lose money

[Tesla's gross profit margin is substantially higher than any other auto manufacturer.](http://i.imgur.com/nzDI1Qh.png) They could be profitable right now if they wanted to, but they opt to invest a metric fuckton on R&D, engineering, and expansion of their facilities.

$1.83 billion in estimated state and federal tax credits **to consumers** for buying electric vehicles and installing solar panels. These are available for electric vehicles and solar panels from any manufacturer.

$1.29 billion in *possible* Nevada state tax breaks over a 20 year period in exchange for building their Gigafactory there. The factory will have an output of ~$5 billion per year, and Musk claims his plan is to triple that output.

$1.01 billion is what New York is spending to build a factory which Tesla will rent from them.

First time I ever came across the concept was from a self-described libertarian, back in the 80's. The difference between the right and left is the motivation - left wingers want it as an improvement to traditional means of social safety nets. Right wing pro-UBI proponents generally see it as a logical necessity past a certain point in time where automation will have essentially eliminated an enormous amount of low-skill/blue-collar jobs. Without UBI or something like it, we'll likely get complete societal collapse, which is even worse for business than higher taxes to finance UBI.

Elon is also a huge proponent of UBI, and he's hardly a 'left wing' guy (at least on economic matters).

329,jwilson1891,http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-trump-advisory-councils-us-paris-agreement-2017-5,">Ok now subtract the $289.7 billion that just three of our oil companies paid from 2007 to 2012, so what does that come to? Because that's just three companies out of the entire industry.

Oh, so you're including taxes paid in other countries? If that's the case, you should include subsidies from other countries as well. Global pre-tax subsidies are over $492 billion, and post-tax subsidies are at $2 trillion. *Annually*. [Source.](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/31/How-Large-Are-Global-Energy-Subsidies-42940)

Secondly, these companies have to follow the same tax code as everyone else. They paid so much in taxes because they made so much money. They don't need or deserve subsidies any more than any other companies, especially when the health and environmental cost of their industry is borne almost entirely by the taxpayers and dwarfs any direct subsidies they're receiving. If we held them financially responsible for the health and environmental costs they cause, they'd be bankrupt tomorrow. But we don't do that, so it's kind of amazing that you give them a pass on all of that, but you're bitching about Tesla receiving such a relatively tiny amount in ""handouts"", a large percentage of which aren't even handouts to begin with.

>Liar.

Let me walk you through this. Click on your own link, then click ""financials"" on the left side. Look at that data. Now let me explain the concept of ""gross profit margin"".

Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue

It's their profit margin on vehicle manufacturing, before any additional expenses like engineering, R&D, facilities expansion, etc. Ford's gross profit margin was 10.74% last quarter. Tesla's was 24.77%. And what makes Tesla interesting compared to other vehicle manufacturers is that it has such a high gross profit margin despite being a relatively small company. Normally you would expect that margin to increase as production increases, due to economies of scale.

>rather than free government handouts being taxed out of the hands of the poor and middle class

First, the amount of ""handouts"" they're benefiting from are tiny compared to many other companies. Second, all of benefits they receive from states are because the states think it will be economically beneficial for them to do so. Third, maybe you didn't read and/or understand my previous comment, but 37% of those ""handouts"" are tax credits *for consumers*. It's a handout to taxpayers. 26% are in potential future tax breaks from the state of Nevada, on the condition that they build the world's largest battery factory there and bring $100 billion in economic benefits to the state. Tesla hasn't received those tax breaks yet. 21% are in the form of a rental agreement with the state of New York. 11% is from *other companies* buying their carbon credits in California.

Your ""free government handouts"" narrative is total nonsense, especially when you don't apply it to the companies that receive the most corporate welfare.",politics,t2_oycp5,6eh29l,diboret,/r/politics/comments/6eh29l/elon_musk_just_threatened_to_leave_trumps/diboret/,/r/politics/comments/6eh29l/elon_musk_just_threatened_to_leave_trumps/

370,a_username_0,http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-trump-advisory-councils-us-paris-agreement-2017-5,"There are plenty of people who are doing that, Musk isn't in unique in that regard.  And again, I think the public investment in those ventures are what's beneficial rather than the individual perusing them.  

I also don't know how much of all that are his honest beliefs and how much are his personal pitches.  The man has a habit of reping his own stuff puts alot of effort into putting an inspirational spin on things.  Everytime I see him give and interview or a talk it's like he's in pitch mode (it's possible he doesn't have any others).  

Part of his image is that of deep thinker, that deeply creative innovator, but I don't know how much of that is him and how much of that the public foisting it upon him because they desperately want him to be the next Steve Jobs.  

I don't think he's a bad guy (of course, that all depends on how you define ""bad""), but the fact that the public is so enamored with him isn't good.  Development of something sound requires alot of minds working together, building off or eachother and challenging eachother, finding holes in the logic and cracks in the foundation.  Musk seems to brute force most things, which can be good when it comes to getting something specific accomplished, but doesn't necessarily lead to the best results.  Right now the public is acting like a collective 'yes man' for him, and it's going to cause things to cost more and take longer to come to fruition.  He needs to be intellectually challenged to stay grounded or his heads going to get so big he'll find his way to Mars before SpaceX does.  

Just my 2 cents.

He also wrote Stranger in a Strange Land, which at least in part pushed ideas on the other end of the spectrum. 

You can see from some of his speeches that he was very pro-military and even pro-war. And to some extent he certainly used Starship Troopers as a means to discuss some of his views.

Yeah and the numbers you threw out included foreign taxes, so you should also include foreign subsidies.

>that has been making a multi-billion dollar fortune in free government handouts for Elon Musk

That fortune is in stock holdings. That stock value is based on increasing revenue and a strong gross margin. Look, 47% of Tesla's ""handouts"" haven't even happened yet, and 37% of them are handouts to consumers. $2.3 billion of the $4.9 billion in total subsidies are spread out over the next 20 years. That's $115 million per year. Tesla is projected to top $10 billion in revenue this year. Don't pretend like the company is getting rich off of handouts, or that subsidies are somehow responsible for Tesla's $57 billion market cap.

>Im not defending their subsidies.

That's weird because you literally just did that.

And on the west coast, where most of these vehicles are sold, coal makes up a small percentage of their power sources.

It takes a lot of effort to transition and there are many risks along the way. Especially since most businesses actually make decisions via groupthink. It's actually kind of rare to have business leaders like a Jobs or Musk or Zuckerberg that can substantially change a company's course. 

So in mass over time many businesses opt to retreat from change till the last second possible. The demise of a business is an easier motivator than the promise of growth (even though there is much literature written to help convince management otherwise). 

So why does coal and cotton and blockbuster wait instead of innovate? Because it's *hard*, and someone else is able to start it new and leapfrog.

1. A ""win at all costs"" culture in his Uber organization.


2. Comments in GQ about how easy it is for him to attract women now


3. Blasé about issues of safety for female Uber customers

What are you guys even arguing with this line? Cause you fuckin use it all the time. It's like saying ""That's how it works, when I hit you with a hammer, it hurts."" I know, stop it.

>The people that drive Uber do it out of their own free will, because they can make a profit.

Ok, and people turning tricks are doing it of their own ""free will"" for profit too. Freeness of will is a spectrum that you find yourself pretty low on when rent is due.

Argue it however you want, but back when this shining star of a free market system was invented, it would have been insane to expect an employee to show up with $10k+ of their own equipment to work for half of minimum wage. The free market used to respect and reward ingenuity and effort. Henry Ford is remembered for revolutionizing the assembly line, Edison for the thousand revisions it took him to get it. Now businessmen are respected for their ability to whittle every penny into profits and dodge taxes. It used to be ""A chicken in every pot and a car in every garage."" Now it's ""that job isn't meant to provide a living wage, sorry."" I don't know what kind of market it is now, but free is not the word that comes to mind.",politics,t2_aeqwd,5iarhr,db81k02,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/db81k02/,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/

It’s me,” he told a Wisconsin TV station on Tuesday. “I don’t wanna change. Everybody talks about, ‘Oh well, you’re gonna pivot, you’re gonna’ — I don’t wanna pivot. I mean, you have to be you. If you start pivoting, you’re not being honest with people.”

>The latest example: According to Bloomberg Politics, a Trump campaign staffer emailed surrogates on Sunday telling them not to talk about the Trump University case. Mr. Trump had been facing criticism for his racist comments about the judge in that case, Gonzalo Curiel, and the email told surrogates, “The best possible response is ‘the case will be tried in the courtroom in front of a jury — not in the media.’”

>Mr. Trump had other ideas. “Are there any other stupid letters that were sent to you folks?” he asked in a conference call high-profile Republicans on Monday. “You guys are getting sometimes stupid information from people that aren’t so smart.”

>“But critics who tell Trump to behave more maturely, even presidentially, are missing something crucial: The President-elect probably cannot control himself,” D’Antonio wrote in the New York Daily News. “
D'Antonio wrote the piece days after Trump wrote a critical Tweet about a local union chief at Carrier who had slammed Trump as a liar.

>**“No matter who criticizes him, no matter the consequences, he will keep doing it,” he added.**

>As is typical with most campaigns, Manafort wanted the Trump team to perform opposition research on its own candidate, so that the team would know what to be worried about and how to prepare for it. Manafort had known Trump since the ’80s and had heard rumors about his behavior with women, according to a source. He wanted to know what was out there. But Trump — perhaps believing that the Clinton campaign would never bring up women for fear of the specter of Bill’s past, or perhaps believing that it wouldn’t matter if they did (the “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody” hubris) — declined. The only information the campaign had to go on was the research the RNC had done into all of the candidates’ public statements.

>In late April, Manafort assured RNC members that Trump would pivot to a more presidential “persona.” And for a while, it worked. Trump began using a teleprompter, cut back his TV appearances, and (mostly) avoided courting scandal. His poll numbers climbed, until he was tied with Clinton.

>But asking Trump to not be the center of attention is like asking him not to breathe. “His ego couldn’t handle it,” said one Republican close to the campaign. “Hillary understood that Trump needed to be the focus.” As his poll numbers climbed, Trump felt he didn’t need to listen to Manafort. “The worst part about Trump is when he was ahead,” the prominent Republican said. “He’d get into the lead and then he would veer off and start defending his interests and his honor and it had nothing to do with what people actually care about. He’s not disciplined.”

1390,EightsOfClubs,http://thehill.com/policy/technology/310321-trump-names-elon-musk-uber-ceo-to-advisory-team,"Ok, first off, I should state my biases pretty openly: 

I work for a direct competitor of SpaceX. Well... that is to say, that SpaceX wishes they were our competitor. The truth is, SpaceX is light years behind where they claim to be, and not _nearly_ as independent as they like the public to feel.

So let's start there. My first task for you would be: Name a piece of hardware that NASA has developed in house. I'll save you the time, you won't think of anything. Every piece of equipment is developed by a contractor. ""NASA's SLS"" is actually ""Boeing's SLS"". Orion? That's Lockheed. Most of the ISS SIE? That's Honeywell. etc. So am I saying NASA is not important? Not at all! They provide _direct oversight_ to those projects, and ensure that we aren't needlessly killing people. In fact, no rocket flies in the US without consent of NASA. Somehow, someway, SpaceX has managed to de-couple its image from NASA, but they wouldn't be as far as they are without the NASA oversight. However, everyone is now creaming their jeans over the fact that there's a ""private space company"" in the US now. It's nothing new -- it's even the same mission structure: SpaceX is currently under contract to ferry equipment to the ISS, much like other companies are under contract to say, build and launch OSIRIS-REx, or Insight, or whatever.

So, let's get to Musk's announcement last month... where he dictates that he's going to go to Mars, he's going to send 100 people at a time, and he's going to do it in 10 years.

Wait the fuck a minute. Hold on.

You mean he's going to take the ITS from _a fucking fuel tank_ (that's all that's done) to fully operating spacecraft in 10 years? And he's going to scale this up so that he can take 100 people at a time? Give me a fucking break. He's had some accomplishments, don't me wrong - the vertical landings have been great. That said, humans are a _whole different ball game_. The guy hasn't even flown a fully qualified ECLS-enabled craft yet. Once he flies it for the first time (likely unmanned, because that's how they all start) and gets a shit ton of data back, it's _going_ to be back to the drawing board for a while. It just is. Look at Orion - built by a company who has _literally built a manned capsule before_ - they flew in 2014, and it's going to be _another two years_ before they fly again. It isn't that they're wrapped up in red tape from NASA, it's literally that scaling up a system to include ECLS is not an easy proposition (and Orion was built _specifically_ to scale well). From there, it will be another 4 years (let's be realistic here, likely 6) before humans fly on it. There's 10 years right there. To get humans in space. By a company that's done it before.... and this guy has the _gall_ to say he's going to be at Mars in that time frame.

So why do I say he's a fool? I don't like anyone who overpromises and underdelivers. He's had some successes, but he needs to learn how to walk before he starts talking trash about his olympic marathon bid.",politics,t2_aeqwd,5iarhr,db7kt4o,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/db7kt4o/,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/

China is a nationalistic country.

It has serious discussion of Trump, and the people there are serious supporters, but they do not take themselves seriously. 

That runs completely opposed to r/politics, which does take itself seriously, and which is supposed to be an unbiased neutral ground for both Republicans and Democrats.

Taxis, however, have:

1. Passed me counterfeit money. When visiting Argentina, I've actually taken to photographing the money I hand them and videotaping the transaction. No such troubles with Uber.

2. Taken me asinine routes to run up the meter, once costing me a missed flight in Boston. No issues with Uber.

3. Put me in danger of life and limb with erratic driving. I'm looking at you again, Boston. Never had an issue with Uber doing that.

4. Used fake meters to overcharge me even when taking the proper route. Again, with Uber this would of course be impossible.

5. Really provided unpleasant, rude, and dirty experiences consistently. I've never in my life had a pleasant cab ride. I've only once had an other-than-pleasant Uber ride, and the company made it right when I complained.

Now, fast food isn't great. But the nice thing about McDonald's is that is that if I don't like them, I can go to Wendy's, or a sit-down restaurant, or any number of options. Whereas with a regulatory capture taxi system, you're dealing with basically a cartel.

They were great at creating an environment where you were encouraged to reveal mistakes and ask for help if swamped so that as a team we could solve any problems and be on time at the end.

F9 is taking on the role that the Ares-1 was supposed to fill, but at a cost of development that's two orders of magnitude lower, and a cost of launch that's about 1/6th. And far safer too - Ares-1's SRB-based design had significant non-survivable phases during launch. And the SLS is going to launch the same year as Ares-V would have *if they had been able to keep the original constellation schedule*, which they obviously wouldn't. I think the earliest 'realistic' projections put the first Ares-V launch somewhere in the mid 2020's. The cost to keep things 'on schedule' were absolutely ridiculous - $150 billion - so that would *never* have happened.

Seriously, there was *nothing* defensible about Constellation as a program. The bits arguably worth saving (Orion) did get saved.

This has been going on for decades, in fact, NASA has always done most of the actual building of rockets through contracting and subcontracting to private industry like Boeing. The articles you linked seem to focus on cancellation of Constellation program but that is because the program itself was underfunded and wouldn't have succeeded, so it was morphed into a better funded program under Obama. Spacex is forcing bloated monopoly government contractors who have stagnated for decades on the NASA teat to actually push themselves to innovate and control costs. 

>Subsequent to the findings of the Augustine Committee in 2009 that the Constellation Program could not be executed without substantial increases in funding, on February 1, 2010, President Barack Obama announced a proposal to cancel the program, effective with the passage of the U.S. 2011 fiscal year budget,[6][7][8][9] but later announced changes to the proposal in a major space policy speech at Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010. Obama signed the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 on October 11, which shelved the program,[10] with Constellation contracts remaining in place until Congress would act to overturn the previous mandate.[11][12] In 2011, NASA announced that it had adopted the design of its new Space Launch System.

1822,jmpherso,http://thehill.com/policy/technology/310321-trump-names-elon-musk-uber-ceo-to-advisory-team,"As I posted in another comment - I don't know why you'd bring up /r/politics.

I think /r/politics is shit. Why is it that any time T_D is questioned, it's flipped to ""so is /r/politics"" without any knowledge of the perspective of the person questioning it?

I think /r/politics is terrible, considering its goal is to be unbiased. HufPo, which imo is no better than Buzzfeed, regularly hits the top spot. It's pitiful. That being said - we're talking about a demographic who's definitely going to be naturally left biased (tech savvy internet-goers), so creating a default ""unbiased"" politics subreddit is pretty much impossible. The only way would be to only allow news coming from verified unbiased news sites (agreed upon by both liberals and conservatives), and that in itself is a massive task, and posts that are positive regarding the right would still just get downvoted.

Also - I think you're kind of using an excuse. T_D takes itself very seriously, but then when it needs to defend itself it just defaults to ""lol we're trolling"" instead of actually discussing. It's a pretty perfect defense mechanism. You talk seriously about the politics until you come across a tough spot, then you just act like it's all a joke and sweep it under the rug.

TD : ""Rex Tillerson is going to be such a badass SoS, Trump is going to bring America into energy independence. The next four years is going to be revolutionary.""

Outsider : ""Well, it's not like Rex can just create oil in the US. There's simply not enough oil here to be independent in that regard. The only options really are to pursue other avenues of energy, make deals with potentially shady sellers (or as you'd say, ""giving money to terrorists""), or focus all of our efforts here but run out of resources *very* quickly. And not only that - isn't this kind of counter intuitive to the whole ""drain the swamp thing""? I wouldn't consider the CEO of ExxonMobil to be a ""drain the swamp"" pick. Not asking to try and argue, I legitimately just want more perspective from this side on the topic.""

TD : ""WHATS WRONG LIBBY BOY YOUR HEAD CAN'T WRAP AROUND THE GRAND PLAN? THE KREMLIN SAYS BYE. GET FUKT.""

Outsider is banned.

I understand your sentiment - and agree with it. /r/politics is garbage in general, and posts from HufPo make it to the top post. That doesn't change the fact that Trump supporters are kind of between a rock and a hard place in regards to a lot of what's happening. The guy claimed he was draining the swamp and getting rid of corruption and just appointed the CEO of ExxonMobil. Rick Perry, Jeff Sessions, Ben Carson? How is that even remotely draining a swamp or getting rid of the whole ""insider/big name"" landscape? And then he does something that doesn't align with the over the top narrative of TD users, and instead of actually talking about why it's bad/good, they do what you just did, and try and turn it into a ""haha I'm trolling"" comment about ""libs"" being fuckups. TD was denouncing PepsiCo and Tesla left and right for ages, now they have to pretend it's fine (via deflecting and making fun of liberals ""heads exploding"") because they refuse to question anything Trump does.

Also - it's very typical Trump supporter of you to totally ignore what I said and instead just try and attack back, rather than discuss the problem that I brought up. I got banned from TD when I responded to someone with a well thought out, reasonable response about how both sides should have better sources for news before anyone starts screaming ""biased garbage #fakenews"" at eachother. It got upvoted a *lot*, and then a mod who didn't agree sent me a personal message attacking me personally, and then banned me.

TD users are really blinded with this, sorry to be blunt, fucking stupid hatred of the ""left"" and the ""libs"" and then ""dems"". Many (like, a shit ton, especially on Reddit) of us aren't big Hillary supporters. We wanted Bernie, and a lot of the reason was for the same reason Trump supporters wanted Trump. Obviously there's a lot of huge differences, but my point is there's too much blind hatred coming from the right towards people that it doesn't even make sense to be attacking.",politics,t2_aeqwd,5iarhr,db71hvi,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/db71hvi/,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/

This is what people say when they don't believe something.

The airframes you see the military using right now were made before mp3 players became common. 90's airframes, *manufactured* in the 90's using technology from the 70's. Those airframes are getting old, and things wear out. Bearings wear down, aluminum corrodes, and things just wear out. At a certain point, it starts to get really pricy doing the continual inspections and replacement of old parts - you're talking about 250 man hours to remove a large airframe component and x-ray large pieces of it to detect literally microscopic hidden cracks that would eventually lead to major disasters. 

This is not a question of ""well if this is actually true"". It is simply a fact of life in aerospace that airframes only get more and more expensive to maintain - I say that having been a maintainer of military aircraft but also civilian, I'm quite literally typing this from inside an aircraft hanger.

As far as ""more cuts could be made"" I'm not sure what you talking about. Pilots have to fly a certain amount of hours every month to retain competency and be able to handle flight, combat, and emergencies. That, more than any other technology, results in the most powerful air combat branches in the world.

>Happy with economic stability and taking steps towards affordable healthcare reform? Yes, I don't think you remember how shitty it was 8 years ago when Bush left office.

Trump isn't going to scrap healthcare for 12 million people. I think a healthy market would be better than Obamacare. Look at how much the Premiums went up this year.

>Tell me again how Benghazi, emails, Bill Clinton, Cheese Pizza, Satan Worshipping cults aren't the embodiment of fear mongering.

Because those things actually happened. Hillary said she wouldn't run a campaign based on fear but a campaign based on issues, yet the entire convention was nothing but a fear fest. Again, Trump isn't even in office but he is the devil. Hillary actually did terrible things pretty much her entire life.

>Housing market crash of 2008 caused by Wall Street, we had to bail out the (not so) Federal Reserve.

We shouldn't have bailed them out. That was rewarding criminality.

>Please tell me how appointing Billionaires to our upper echelons of office is the correct way to fix this. I'm still waiting for my Trickle Down check since Reagan.

Because they actually know how to make money and aren't tied to foreign donors, rather a prosperous America that wants to spend money?

>Idk man, when Obama came into office we had Texas threatening to secede from the U.S. as well as riots, it's not much different from 2008 from what I've seen so far.

I'm not talking about State Governments here I'm talking about the Federal Government. There has been no peaceful transition so far with the failed recounts, death threats and bribes to Electors, censorship of the Internet, and they aren't done.

Edit: Neil Armstrong and Eugene Cernan, among others, [testified before Congress regarding the Constellation program.](http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1005/12hearing/) They objected to the proposal to ax Constellation in favor of subsidizing the private space industry due to concerns that it would prolong the gap between the shuttles' retirement and the next man-rated rocket, and that the private industry risks being less adherent to safety considerations than the public program due to its responsibility to investors and financial stakeholders.

[Musk responded to their testimony by claiming that Armstrong was being manipulated.](http://www.space.com/9826-elon-musk-neil-armstrong-spacex-constellation.html) The fact that he levied what looks like a personal insult at a national hero over his completely valid concerns left me with a negative opinion of Musk that he has done little to change.

Elon Musk is a salesman. He is the Steve Jobs of the electric car and private space industries. Reddit has an unwarranted obsession with him because he says he wants to retire on Mars.

And again, to be clear, I have no problem with SpaceX itself. I have a problem that the government is subsidizing the private space industry at the expense of the public program.",politics,t2_aeqwd,5iarhr,db6sbeo,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/db6sbeo/,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/

2023,ComesWithTheFall,http://thehill.com/policy/technology/310321-trump-names-elon-musk-uber-ceo-to-advisory-team,"Well, sorry you got banned. Nowadays, most liberal counter arguments are left untouched and even upvoted if they think the person is being genuine. They take it as an opportunity to 'redpill' or inform the person. 

Understand that most TD users are very sensitive to 'narratives'. Especially with this *fake news* narrative, which is laying the groundwork for dangerous censorship. When CNN has been caught using their own cameraman as a fake protestor[\[1\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W26aqd35LUU), was caught telling their audience panel what to say after a debate[\[2\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqCIub3SmCI), told viewers that looking at wikileaks is illegal[\[3\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X16_KzX1vE), faked a SCUD missile attack in the Gulf War[\[4\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTWY14eyMFg), faked a satellite connection in a parking lot[\[5\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGADrt5hhwM), faked being on a boat with a greenscreen[\[6\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn5pIkEHPf0), .... they then have the audacity to call Breitbart and Infowars fake news. 

As a TD user from the beginning (under different usernames), most TD'ers don't see the swamp as consisting of businesses or corporations. The swamp consists of politicians, the media, bankers, and foreign governments (and maybe pizza shops). Most TD'ers believe that business is inherently good. After all, to earn a dollar you have to help someone (unless you're making dollars in the swamp). Hardcore leftists/communists see business as inherently evil, and that's simply not the case. They think there is a limited amount of wealth, like a pie, and that people who make a lot of money are taking a bigger slice of the pie, thus depriving other people of their fair share. The truth is businesses *create* wealth, and money just keeps score of how much each person has contributed to the wealth of society.

In all my time in TD, the *only* criticism (mostly suspicion) I've seen associated with Elon Musk is that George Soros invested in Solar City. That's it. I'd say most people are huge Musk fans, as is most of reddit and myself. 

People in TD are not afraid to disagree with Trump. One of the biggest disagreements is Trump's statement a long time ago that Snowden is a traitor. Many people were also not happy at all with the Pence pick for VP. Over time, and particularly after the VP debate, everyone loved Pence. From the past year and a half they really trust Trump and his decisions. That's the crux of it. 

But they aren't afraid to hold him accountable. If you know your history, you'll know that TD was forged out of the fires of 4chan's /pol/ board. Many of the memes and ideas that originate there still propagate to TD and the rest of the internet. There is a faction there that is constantly paranoid that Trump will sell out and not live up to his promises. Remember, one of the main selling points on Trump is he is not a typical politician, who says one thing and does another. The entire country is very tuned into this point. If he sells out, the entire red portions of the country will be pissed.

To understand TD, you have to understand that most TD'ers are fighting a different battle than your average r/politics user or average r/conservative user from a year ago. The latter two are (or were) still stuck in a left-right, blue-red paradigm, bickering over definitions of marriage, technicalities of baby killing, or <insert emotional wedge issue>. The TD'er has transcended all this and is fighting *the swamp* and their systems of control. This includes cultural marxism, equality of outcome, and political correctness. The enemy isn't just a guy wearing a blue tie or red tie arguing about some trivial issue. The enemy are globalists who are subverting all of western culture and trying to destroy it and/or centrally control it.

I actually can't argue with you here that often Simulation Theory is a fun exercise that takes eschatological and gnostic motifs and runs with them via computer metaphors. I actually think this is a really interesting point of study: many technologists are obsessed with rather religious sounding ideas. Simulation Theory is a pretty intriguing way of thinking about our reality and how it works, similar to how the steam engine was once used to talk about the human mind. The technological imagination of modern culture is isomorphic to various theologies and there have been plenty of academic books in the humanities discussing this subject. 

So while we could dismiss it as ""bad theology,"" it's also intriguing from an anthropological and cultural studies perspective.

Whether or not these are true? Well, again, I suggest that the religious motifs themselves are more important than the particular metaphors used (holograms, computers, simulations, etc).

There's a good essay about it here from a friend who is a stronger advocate of the theory than myself: [""Why it Matters That You Realize You're in a Computer Simulation""](http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/Edge20151114)

You are refusing to look at the situation critically while condemning Trump without having actual facts to back up your claim.

You are refusing to look at the work that has already been done before inauguration that will bring back jobs and money to the US economy.

You claiming that this team is ""dangerous"" based off of your perception that has not been formed through critical analysis, is why Trump won. 

The fact remains; you do not know if this is dangerous. Also, when you look at the other option this election, it is undeniable that this was the safe option.

I disagree. I believe those regulations are an example of [regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture). For example:

> They are still free to open an Uber Taxi Service there if they comply with the regulations but they don't seem to be interested in doing that.

Actually, they can't.

Munich is the only major city in Germany which doesn't limit the total number of operators that can exist. All others put a limit. So, in order to operate, Uber would have to *buy out* existing incumbents who have a cartel on the number of licenses.

And in terms of the *real world*, Germany is a rare exception, but in general consumers are *far* better protected with Uber than they are with taxis. With taxis, you have them taking dubious routes, using tampered with meters, passing fake notes, etc. With Uber, you have one company to deal with in case something goes wrong, and failing that, you can chargeback a credit card.

Finally, in terms of insurance, Uber is constantly losing money and far from profitable, but it is very capable of paying out any judgment in excess of €10m.

Certainly you can't be serious in believing this whole fight is simply a matter of consumer safety.",politics,t2_aeqwd,5iarhr,db71tdb,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/db71tdb/,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/

Cantrell tells us that he soon discovered that he and Musk shared an affinity for applied knowledge, and he loaned him some textbooks to study (they ""were never returned, by the way!"" Cantrell says). The books were ""Rocket Propulsion Elements,"" ""Aerothermodynamics of Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion,"" ""Fundamentals of Astrodynamics,"" and the ""International Reference Guide to Space Launch Systems.""

He doesn't know exactly how Musk would read or take notes, but he knows that he practically memorized them.

""He would quote passages verbatim from these books. He became very conversant in the material,"" Cantrell says.

He built a network of the smartest people.

Musk ""knows everything about what he's building,"" Cantrell says, but of course even he understands that he can't master everything. That's why he used Cantrell's network in the aerospace industry to gather some of the best in the business. ""It was like spaceapalooza!""

I'm not sure what universe you grew up in, but republicans had control for many, many years of my life, and barely did a thing to lower taxes.  I'm not talking about a pathetic little 1% change here or there.  They supported high taxes just like the democrats.  Where are the plans to lower the rate to a 5% flat tax?  Where are the plans to eliminate the income tax altogether?  The republicans are liars.  They support high taxation just like the rest of them.

> He was also for allowing the states to decide their own Marijuana laws. 

Yet he's appointing Jeff Sessions as Attorney General.  Sessions is an extreme anti-marijuana lunatic.  He's going to be the top law enforcement authority in the country.  I wouldn't be surprised if he prioritizes raids on dispensaries in states where it's legal.  Nothing would surprise me anymore.  Legal marijuana is likely going to be under full attack with Sessions at the helm.

> Honestly, it sounds like you didn't do much research this election cycle. 

On the contrary, I did *real* research.  It sounds like you just blindly believe whatever politicians say.  In case you don't realize it, Trump is a liar.  I know that might be hard to swallow for you.

Now, if Trump actually follows through, ends our foreign interventionist policy, lowers tax (really lowers them, not just a bullshit 2%), and paves the way for legal marijuana, then I'll change my tune.  I'll admit I was wrong.

In this regard, I hope our new president is successful.  I hope he follows through.  I'll be behind him if he does.  But right now, I don't trust him.

2176,foldingcouch,http://thehill.com/policy/technology/310321-trump-names-elon-musk-uber-ceo-to-advisory-team,"You've said a lot of words here, and that's great. 

The first problem here is that we're starting from a position of ""what I take Trump's position to be.""  Not what his position *is*, what we *presume* it is because he hasn't actually *said* what it is.  Y'all voted for this guy to bring back the jobs and make America great again, but he hasn't actually said how he's going to accomplish that.  All we know is that he threatened a tax on Carrier for taking jobs out of Indiana, and turned around and paid them to take jobs out of Indiana.  

The other problem is while ""favor American businesses within our borders while selling more products globally"" sounds great, it's not happening.  America cannot compete with Chinese labor.  With billions of dollars of investment in entirely new factories that are massively automated (read: few-to-no working-class jobs) America might be able to get *close* to Chinese production cost efficiency, but it won't be within Trump's term in office that's going to happen and it's going to be a hard sell to corporate America who won't want to invest billions in America just to have a slightly worse return on investment than they already have manufacturing in China. 

Plus, if you're favoring American business within America, what that really means is Americans paying more for the same products.  The cost of ""buying American"" is going to fall to the consumer, and since Trump and the GOP are clearly all about the right to work and not raising minimum wage, Americans aren't going to have any more money to buy these products.  This is how recessions happen. 

The final problem is this ""Sell more products globally"" thing, which is going to be a big problem because America is now competing with the cheap labor in southeast Asia and as I mentioned before, you're not favored in that race.  China has America beat on cost of labor, America's only edge is in automation and technical innovation, and America is about twenty years behind Germany in that respect.  

That was always the great myth of the Trump campaign - he's going to bring back all these jobs and trade better, except there's no magic wand that he can wave to do that.  The kind of economy we hope he wants to build is a decade away, and doesn't have a place for the unskilled blue-collar laborers that voted for him to get their jobs back.  There's no plan.  The economics don't work.  That's why a few hundred economists signed a letter to Americans saying not to vote for the man, because he's spouting economic nonsense that's completely non-viable.

Yes, China is not a perfectly free market, and is in many ways a less free market than the US, but it is a whole lot freer than it was 40 years ago.

It takes a lot of time to transition economies from protectionism to free-trade, and it can be a painful process. The mere fact that China hasn't gotten all the way there yet is not reason to force everyone back into protectionism.

If at this point we say ""China hasn't opened up enough, so let's close ourselves off from them"", then not only would that be a bone-headed thing to do with regards to our economy and world peace, but it would completely misunderstand what we should expect of China as a trading partner.

2207,jmpherso,http://thehill.com/policy/technology/310321-trump-names-elon-musk-uber-ceo-to-advisory-team,"The thing is, that's all your perspective. That's not how *all* of TD is. And that's one of the most enormous issues with TD. The two most upvoted top comments in any given post can entirely contradict one another.

Also - you're *still* preaching to the choir here. I don't think either side has much ground to stand on in this ""fake news"" discussion - although yes, a huge media outlet like CNN spreading fake news is potentially more harmful than smaller ones. That being said, websites like The Gateway Pundit regularly get used as a source on T_D. Crazy right wing ""news"" websites aren't good either. Both sides are often times garbage. Things like NYT and WP are constantly riddled with clearly biased, cherry picked news, but then right wing websites do the exact same thing (they're just less popular).

If you search ""Musk"" in T_D, anything older than 2 days ago is straight up crazy hatred. Now it's all just ""LIBERALS HEADS EXPLODE AS MUSK NOW ADVISING TRUMP"". Which - really, doesn't even make sense. Liberals *want* other Liberals advising Trump. If anything, their heads are exploding in that Trump made a choice they agree with - not that Musk has somehow ""flipped"".

>People in TD are not afraid to disagree with Trump. One of the biggest disagreements is Trump's statement a long time ago that Snowden is a traitor. Many people were also not happy at all with the Pence pick for VP. Over time, and particularly after the VP debate, everyone loved Pence. From the past year and a half they really trust Trump and his decisions. That's the crux of it.

That's.. not really a good point. The crux of it is that conservatives are following the conservative leader, and the fact that it's someone outspoken and obnoxious just feeds into the ""hype"". The left isn't that way right now. People aren't following Hillary.

I also do think people are afraid to disagree with Trump in TD - because you *literally get banned for doing so.* That's just how it is. I didn't even disagree with Trump, just some other poster, and I got banned because it didn't fit TD's narrative.

>The latter two are (or were) still stuck in a left-right, blue-red paradigm, bickering over definitions of marriage, technicalities of baby killing, or <insert emotional wedge issue>. The TD'er has transcended all this and is fighting the swamp and their systems of control. This includes cultural marxism, equality of outcome, and political correctness. The enemy isn't just a guy wearing a blue tie or red tie arguing about some trivial issue. The enemy are globalists who are subverting all of western culture and trying to destroy it and/or centrally control it. Listen to this episode of the Rabbi Daniel Lapin podcast if you want more insight.

I'm sorry - but that's still just a left-right, blue-red paradigm. You're just acting like Trump supporters are a transcendent version of the right. 99% of the time, ""the swamp"" is referring to leftist politicians and their allies/supporters.

There's **constant** vitriol towards anyone on the left, regardless of if they're just wanting to learn more/talk/discuss openly. T_D is not a place where people are welcome to come and get insight, it's literally built to be an echochamber.

I understand the plight, and the fight against this ""swamp"", but replacing one swamp with another swamp is clearly not going to achieve anything - and I think a lot of Trump supporters are blinded by faith, and ignoring the fact that these appointments aren't doing any ""draining"".

I also think that your massive generalization of ""the left hates business"" is absolutely 100% batshit crazy. I consider myself left in a lot of ways (right in some too), and I can't even begin to understand what you mean. My issue isn't with business, my issue is with too much leeway for the rich getting richer. I would rather see more incentive to decrease the gap between upper class and the lower classes. I don't think employing an absolute fuck ton of people at barely-livable wages, allowing a rich CEO to expand their business enormously for a tiny cost, is a good thing. I think that's a really scummy way to act like ""Look, we're making jobs!"" I think the biggest issues are things like creating opportunities for people stuck in low-paying jobs to grow, and fixing the education system so that people who grow up poor/in bad households/whatever aren't doomed from the beginning. I don't believe Trump believes in that at all.",politics,t2_aeqwd,5iarhr,db7aqff,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/db7aqff/,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/
2208,LatverianCyrus,http://thehill.com/policy/technology/310321-trump-names-elon-musk-uber-ceo-to-advisory-team,"One of the things I often see bandied about is that left wingers think all business is evil. That's not really true, though, or there wouldn't be this love affair/jealousy/whatever with Musk.

The point of view I often see is that the goal of a business is, first and foremost, to make money. There are those like Musk who look at the long game and try and invest in future technologies, and there are those who take the short game like the banks who profited on sub-prime mortgages. Both in the end, though, are in it for the money. Musk is cornering future markets, and the banks wanted to have good quarterly reports for their shareholders. The problem is, although both make money, only one contributes to the public good. 

...which is why the left doesn't like big business, but they do like big government. Government's goal isn't to have a lot of money, but instead to have a lot of happy citizens. So it can take stances that don't earn us more money, but do, say, increase public health. I mean, in a lot of ways government *is* like a corporation, but the voters are its shareholders, and they get to pick what's important. And for many, that isn't just increasing the money score. There are other scores that matter too, like life expectancy, or literacy, or air quality. And sometimes that also means big government putting hampers on big business.

Pretty much everyone agrees that the Model S is not ""more luxurious"" than a comparably priced BMW 7 series or Mercedes S class.

And the Model X definitely has some large ""luxury issues"" as well. Such as [misaligned trim, uneven paint, and climate control issues](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tesla-model-x-quality-issues-885618). Misaligned body panels on a car that starts at $75K? Are you kidding me?

Nor does the Model S have much better range -- if at all -- than other pure EV's on the market. The Chevy Bolt has a 238 mile range. The Model S with the base 60kw battery has a range of about 208 miles, and the and P85 says about 270.

It's just the only luxury EV on the market, and the only EV that could be described as ""Fun"".

The original claim you were disputing was that it would be more expensive to start from scratch than to finish the current project. You claiming it was a sunk cost fallacy, thinking, I assume, that having wasted money on tbe program in the past isnt a justification for wasting more money in the future. However, the sunk cost fallacy is more applicable here to your claim than that of the person you were responding to. 



Due to the amount of money already spent, the cost of finishing the f-35s is relatively low. Its likely possible to design a new aircraft thats cheaper to make and produce plenty of them for less cost than f-35. However, the sunk cost fallacy states that its fallacious to consider costs already sunk (spent) when analyzing the costs and benefits of any set of options. Therefore, instead of comparing the total cost of the f-35 with a theoretical new design, we should compare the cost of this restart with the cost of finishing the f-35s. 



I was letters to label the different costs for easy comparison, but maybe its easier to read this way.

Automation is a good thing, as long as we also implement programs to help the people who lose their livelihoods to it. However, I don't think it's a realistic expectation to believe that the social safety net will *actually* increase alongside automation to the degree that it would need to, especially during a Republican-controlled period of time.

What will actually happen is self-driving cars, or another form of automation, will come about, and now millions of people who drive vehicles to make a living will be slowly made obsolete. We won't have the social infrastructure to help them (because republicans fight and diminish social safety nets tooth and nail every chance they get), so these people will just fall into poverty, unless they're lucky enough to find another low skill job.

The Republicans have always run on a smaller government platform, smaller government means lower taxes. Also Trump appointed Sessions due to his immigration record, not for his Marijuana record. It doesn't really matter what sessions thinks on marijuana because Trump is his boss, and if Trump tells him to let states deal with Marijuana by themselves, and focus on immigration then he will. It sounds like you're the one blindly following the bias media, and liberal talking points.

And for the record, I started out as very critical of Trump, and didn't support him until he was nominated because there was no way in hell I was ever going to support Hillary Clinton. The more research I did on him from that point on the more I realized how much the media hated him, and lied about him. 

And seriously, if both parties were for large government and high taxes, then the tax rate would be much larger than it is right now, and we would probably be way more socialist.

3. Another assertion. How do you know what my financials are?

4. Don't even know how to respond.

5. Not that I want it, but perhaps a Depression will start making people take an interest in what is actually happening in the world around them again instead of regurgitating what is on TV or Facebook. No one thinks critically anymore and I hope you understand the consequences of that. 

6. The Federal Government has been ripping these guys off for years so of course they are getting greedy. Hillary wanted to raise taxes on all Americans and Trump is lowering them. 

7. You are misconstruing his words just like the Media does. He said ""I'll accept the results if she wins legally."" Trump won legally and now she is trying overturn the results illegally. Interesting how you failed to address the coup d'etat that will occur on December 19th. We will know on December 20th for sure that Electors have flipped. They won't announce publicly until Jan 6th. This is not fear mongering. This is real and people need to wake up to what is happening around them. 

8. PEACEFUL PROTEST just worked in South Korea did it not?

9. They did compromise but I don't think you understand what is at stake here. Our country is under control of criminals who are funded by Foreign donors, which is illegal. 

10. The media is to blame for the divisiveness. Would someone that was trying to break people apart hire gays, blacks, women in his administration? Would he speak with the black community about their problems?

The US is 5% of the world's pop but uses 25% of the world's production of resources. If all of HC's voters lived by how they preached, that would be a far greater instigator of change for the energy industry than waiting for the govt to force change. For instance, I'm doing my part by growing my own vegetables ($50 hydroponic setup that's still lasting over a year and has provided me w/ ~$20 worth of salad veggies to eat every week), purchasing locally grown food at cheap farmer's markets, walking, bicycling, using public transpo, my electricity bill 8months out of the year is less than $10, I rarely drive my cheap fuel-efficient car, etc...I know I have lessened my usage/depend. on the oil&gas industry despite living on a limited amount of money as a grad student in Los Angeles... 



My dad is the same way: a physicist, long time independent who leans conservative, and he's the biggest proponent of environmental stewardship than any liberal I've met in Cali. My parents landscaping was made up of succulents and drought-tolerant plants long before LA's water department made water-use rules in response to the drought. Who are the ppl that destroy the environment, waste water, and think the drought rules don't apply to them? Oh yea, liberal Hollywood and the democratic donors (looking at Cher, Barbara Streisand, JLo, George Clooney) who live in Bel Air, Beverly Hills, Malibu, Calabasas, SB, etc bc they can just pay the $100 penalty and increased water payments. 



Also, regulations, both with the EPA/Energy department and taxes, are a big reason why startups in alternative energy can't compete with big energy industries. If Obama was serious about alternative energy, he would have addressed that. I thought he would, which is why I voted for him 2x, but he didn't. Instead, he goes on to invest $800million of taxpayer money in the Solyndra scam despite his admin receiving multiple reports that it was going to be an inevitable failure. Some people walked away with a lot of money from that scam despite receiving absolutely no results. 



In California, Barbara Boxer's husband won a govt bid of $1Billion to build 28 miles of Cali's high speed railway project...that's $35million per mile just for laying down the rail..not including electrifying the route or the cost of acquiring the land or buying the stock. Her husband's firm already previously paid a fine for rackateering and fraud concerning a SF airport contract among others. Why was his firm even allowed to get another bloated govt bid? I want a rail system like S. Korea, Japan, or even DC, but not at the expense of cheating the taxpayer. This project is probably not even going to be completed until 2050, and by that time will be old tech even though it'll cost enough to fund 5 new rail systems.



I realize that govt and the private sector will always intermingle, creating backdoor deals, etc. The thing that bugs me is that people on the left are so willing to, mostly rightly, criticize private industry and the profits made while not being skeptical of govt spending. If govt were a business, it would be bigger than all of our private sector businesses combined. Govt revenue is insane and it would be naive to think that no one profits from the ability to influence politicians or politicians profiting from their connections. People are making a lot of profit in govt, you just don't see it bc the system is convoluted with 1000s of pple profiting instead of 1 CEO making bank.

>It used to be the anti-war party of limiting government in order to preserve personal liberty. That, and fiscal conservatism.

Ha.  No. They use voter suppression & the Southern Strategy to get elected, that's infringing on the most basic of personal liberties in a Denocracy. The economy under both Bush and Reagan was spiked by massive, unnecessary  borrowing.  Under Bush II, the borrowing was not   even recorded as existing.  They are not fiscal conservatives.

The Republicans have known since the 80's that trickle-down doesn't work and they have spiked their tax reductions with borrowing every single time to trick voters.

At this point it's just because they want to destroy government in its current form. And the sad part is it's because they want credit for everything and they've become deranged with hate against the left. Democrats would like to shrink the size of government to but they wanted to do so in a manner that doesn't hurt people and doesn't remove our important protections.



Here's Al Gore in 1993 talking about silly government regulations that need to be rolled back: https://youtu.be/LQHyK3aUvJs


Were it not for the 1994 Republican house victory comma we would have successfully rolled back the size of government between the mature Democrats and the mature Republicans that were in office prior to Gingrich, Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, etc. we're planning to do so responsibly.

>The left isn't that way right now. People aren't following Hillary.

That's because she A) Lost, and B) Isn't a good leader.

>I also do think people are afraid to disagree with Trump in TD - because you literally get banned for doing so. That's just how it is. I didn't even disagree with Trump, just some other poster, and I got banned because it didn't fit TD's narrative.

TD did have a strong deportation policy at one time. We had to until we could figure what the hell was going on. Nowadays it's pretty lax. You are free to disagree. You'll probably even be upvoted if your points are salient and genuine. There aren't mandated narratives in TD.

You use the banking system as an example of an 'evil doing' corporation in your example. There's a reason I mentioned the bankers as a part of The Swamp. Things are very fuzzy when one learns about the mechanics of the banking system & money supply, and it has nothing to do with capitalism or business. Read up on fractional reserve lending. Good sources are [Modern Money Mechanics](http://www.truthsetsusfree.com/ModernMoneyMechanics.pdf) and [The Money Masters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4wU9ZnAKAw).

Business and making money are inherently good, and it's important for people to realize that. The fact is that to earn a dollar, you have to contribute wealth to society, whether that wealth is your time, expertise, sweat, or ingenuity. There are exceptions of course, and those are fraud, theft, or doing something harmful to people or nature.

It's also important to understand that money & wealth are two different things, and they flow in opposite directions. Someone who makes a lot of money has lots of money flowing in their direction because there is a large amount of wealth flowing from them to society. This wealth is constantly being created. The money you have is an IOU from society. You contributed wealth to society, thus you are permitted to 'withdraw' wealth from society using your money. Someone who has earned ten billion dollars is more of a charitable person than a greedy person. They are a fountain of wealth flowing into society, while the dollars are just a score card in a bank ledger. Society is actually in debt to them for $10 billion worth of wealth.

The shareholders of a corporation demanding money to be made is indeed one force, yes. But remember, making money is not inherently evil. It's much more likely to be inherently good. The larger driving force on a corporation's actions are the many more people demanding goods and services. And all of society and humanity benefit from the trickle down effects from business. We can literally fly around the world, communicate instantly across oceans, enjoy fresh foods from all over, wear exotic fabrics, and learn literally anything on YouTube. It's a great thing.

**AT FIRST** you said:

>Trump person here and I just lawled my ass off when i saw this saying ""can't wait to see what the left has to say about this"". I think its great. Elon musk wants to explore space and is also just a talented person. I think its cute you're saying trump supporters are attacking him.

And I replied that--in fact (actual real life, real world, verifiable and transparent fact) the right-wing **has** gone after Musk and IF Trump supporters are those same people to any appreciable degree?  Then, sure, Trump supporters have gone after him.  That's basic reasoning.    Point in fact, Ingraham is a Trump supporter and has gone after Musk (and is, still, technically, as she hasn't retracted a thing)--ergo... yes, Virginia, Trump supporters have.

**THEN** you tried to move the goalposts to say ""--AFTER--"", but I wasn't talking about ""after"" and you weren't either until that point--for that matter, neither was the person you replied to.  Nobody time-boxed the ""attacking"" as being exclusive to after this news story--nobody.  You can start adding things after the fact to make up for the mistake you made claiming something that was factually easy to verify as false (again, quick Google searching)--but you're moving the goalposts and I am under no obligation to help you with that.  Point is, Trump supporters have in the past, and current conservative groups and organizations that have supported Trump are still in that mix... there is no magic ""and everyone was washed of their sins and went on to be totally not accountable for still being those same people"" thing.

You were wrong.  If you're **NOW** claiming you don't think **CURRENT** Trump Supporters are going after Musk, **INSTEAD** of saying they've never done so--that's a completely different point.  One not represented in the prior (screenshotted) posts between us.

No? Thats like saying Kerry has ties to syria because he worked down there with the state department. He was the CEO, when he sells his shares then he will have zero connection to his former company. Exxon could go to 0 and it wouldnt affect him.

Its a good thing that he worked with all these foreign governments, it doesnt mean he owes them something, if anything the exact opposite is probably true.

You have to be able to recognize the difference between small talk and genuine questions, and you have to be friendly about it regardless. If a total stranger asks me ""how's it going?"" I don't assume they genuinely want a rundown of my day. I'd probably say ""fine"" and maybe ask them the same question. But I could also say ""it's going"" or something similar and still be friendly while conveying that I'm not exactly having the time of my life. Likewise, if a total stranger asked me how I like working at my job, I could say ""it pays the bills"" and still be friendly about it, but not give the impression that I really love it. I think you'd be hard pressed to find people that would hold that against me, given that most people feel the same way about their own jobs.

If they're asking beyond that, it's safe to assume they're genuinely interested. The kind of people who expect the Disney treatment aren't typically the ones who venture beyond small talk with strangers. If they're genuinely asking for your personal experiences working for your employer, but they hold it against you when they don't like your answer, then they're shitty people.

When a company doesn't pay, you can actually seize its assets.

I would have no concerns about collecting a judgment either from Uber or from an insurance provider in Germany. I would have a lot more qualms about collecting from a driver and/or insurance provider in a corrupt or undeveloped country.

For example, I would feel *much* safer being in a car accident with an Uber in Mexico City than a Mexico City cab driver. (Assuming the driver even *has* insurance, they are anonymous. They would likely drive away once I exit the vehicle, and I would have no recourse.)

In terms of liability, in the developed world, I would say it's possibly awash. In the developing world, I feel *far* safer and more protected in an Uber. But in terms of just being ripped off, with Uber it's basically impossible. With a cab, it's a near certainty.

EDIT TL;DR: I feel safe-ish in German cabs, but I'll be ripped off and get shitty service. I feel safe in German Ubers, and I'd get good service for a fair price. In the developing world, I feel at extreme risk in taxis, and I feel at ease in Ubers.

This is actually an area of strong interest for me, and being a technology worker myself I can tell you simply how it works.  As a basic example if you can lay off 100 people doing the job, replaced by robots, you'll need only a handful of these people (let's say 10 just to make up a number) to maintain the machinery.  Even if you were able to retrain some of the 100 and pull the 10 workers out of that pool (which is highly unlikely that they have either the skill or aptitude for that type of work) you still have 90 people out of a job.  That's very obviously oversimplifying things, so let me give you an idea of a real world example.

People used to maintain the data for natural gas pipelines by having these monitoring stations every so many miles on the pipeline that would do readings onto paper that someone would drive out and collect the rolls of paper and put new paper/ink/etc, then send them all in to a central office.  At the office, you'd have dozens or more people whose job was to do data entry to a mainframe so this data could be used for understanding pipeline capacity for the business of the company.  Now, there are inexpensive computers connected to private networks that monitor in real-time (not just when someone can drive to the stations) and automatically send their data into a database where it's parsed and used by the marketing people.  This eliminates the need for people to drive around to pipelines and gather data, other than when a remote terminal goes bad or needs replaced.  There's no longer any need to ship the tapes, as the network connections are much simpler to maintain and require less people.  The data entry jobs are completely gone, with one or two people maintaining the software side of things.  This eliminated more jobs than we can imagine.

If that scenario is too complex or poorly explained, consider [phone operators](http://i.imgur.com/rxTfShf.jpg) being replaced by [VOIP systems](http://www.telephonesystems.ae/cisco-phones-uae.jpg).",politics,t2_aeqwd,5iarhr,db70k97,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/db70k97/,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/

2423,LatverianCyrus,http://thehill.com/policy/technology/310321-trump-names-elon-musk-uber-ceo-to-advisory-team,"I agree that money is important. It is a helpful incentive to drive society. And we can agree that a measure of regulations is good, right? The problem is, it often seems that one side of the aisle's main goal is to get rid of regulations altogether. And our president elect has nominated people to positions those same people have previously spoken about getting rid of, thus weakening the government and its ability to regulate. 

They do this in most cases because they believe the private sector can provide these benefits better than the government can, because they have that great incentive of money, while the government only has the incentive of an oft-unhappy populace. But the problem is, those entities are motivated by money, and not public good. Private schools aren't about increasing the overall level by bringing up the lowest, they're about increasing their own personal level by pushing out the lowest. Private prisons aren't about reducing recidivism and reforming inmates, they're about filling cells. Private pharmaceuticals aren't about providing drugs to people who need them, it's about selling drugs to anyone they can.

Yes, government is swampy. But I always kind of assumed a big part of the swamp was politicians who were accepting money in exchange for changing policy, and lobbyists giving money to change policy. Because money is such a good incentive that is can drive people to do things that are harmful to the social well-being. Giving money to loosen protective regulations so that they can earn more money, regardless of at whose expense. Things like textiles being allowed to be made overseas in sweat shops, or telecommunications fighting against google trying to expand free internet, or high-polluting companies pushing to ignore the increasing acidification in our oceans or CO2 content of our atmosphere. Money is such a good incentive... that it needs to be kept out of politics. 

And here's where we'll probably start getting heated... my concern with Trump was always that he *was* one of those heavy donors, spending money for political favors. This means he understands how it's done and could thus be in a good position to fight it (ie, hiring a hacker to deal with cyber security), yes, but I was never sufficiently convinced he wasn't simply in it for his own good. His position during the campaign was always ""they didn't stop me from doing it, so me doing it was smart"". And it *was* smart! He was getting the most of that incredible incentive, money. But it seemed to show a mindset that he was in it for the money, not for the public good. And now, after he's been elected, I'm concerned by him using his position to talk to foreign leaders about getting hotels built; I'm concerned about him towing the party line and weakening government; and because I'm still not certain on him, I'm concerned about him appointing people from similar money-first backgrounds (like Tillerson) to positions designed for public good. I'm concerned people out for themselves have gone from just donating money to influence policy to actually dictating policy themselves.

But if you show genuine interest beyond small talk, drivers are usually pretty open about their experiences. Just from my experience talking to drivers, it seems like the ones that love it generally haven't worked there for very long.

In Colorado, regulators also explicitly required liability coverage from Uber, a regulation the company welcomed.

2) Get humanity using renewable energy sources so we didn't kill ourselves off with climate change.

2519,jmpherso,http://thehill.com/policy/technology/310321-trump-names-elon-musk-uber-ceo-to-advisory-team,"Again - I have no desire to really continue spending time on TD because I expect the same crazy moderation/censorship of any rigorous, meaningful discussion. Which is fine.

Also that's great that you run a successful business, and I'm sure the Rabbi guy has some knowledge on some fronts, but I don't see how that's relevant. Business doesn't just magically translate to politics on a 1:1 level. Trump being a ""good businessman"" and that translating to being at least on some level a ""good president"" is a valid opinion many Trump supporters have, but I don't subscribe to it, and I don't even think he's a terribly good ""business man"" - but if I see his taxes I could change my tune (at least in terms of how good of a business man he is, not how much that translates to being potus).

I've read that pizzagate article. It's riddled with garbage.

For one - a *shit ton* of the pizza talk is actually reasonable, and then people pick the line that makes the least sense and start questioning everything else too much.

For example :

> Who all is in the Austin office today who is going to want pizza? We only have one slice and we need to know how thinly to slice it…

Could very easily just be a stupid joke. Like if your friend is a chef, you eat at his restaurant and you all order his famous steak dinner, and he comes back and says ""alright, so how hungry is everyone, turns out we only have one steak"", everyone makes an oh no face, and the chef goes ""haha just kidding here's the wine"". It's stupid, and not really funny, but it's not ""clearly some code"".

Also, this whole bit :

>Handkerchief — BDSM code, different colors have different meanings but black indicates sadomasochism in some circles (variable depending on community)
Pillows — Drugs (variable)
Cheese Pizza — Child pornography
Cheese — Child
Pasta — Boy
Hot Dog — Boy
Dominos — BDSM domination
Chicken — Young boy

Comes from a very limited number of sources - none of which have actually proven to be tied to anything nefarious, but instead just random people on 4chan claiming they know this ""code"". I mean, if this was swinging the other way - like the e-mails just came out now, and they were all between Trump/Pence/other people, can you imagine how T_D would respond? They'd outright claim it was all obviously just food talk, people being stupid, and totally meaningless, and would completely denounce the stupid ""code"" posted by a guy on 4chan.

There's also a ton of stuff in that article that is the exact same kind of logic-leaps that leads to a guy walking into the establishment with a weapon and firing a shot.

""The likelihood of of a DDOS attack on 4chan at that time being unrelated is close to zero."" That is a perfect example of why this thing can never be looked at seriously, at least not as long as people like that are the ones pushing the information.

I also think the cherry picked images is of course *weird*, but I think it's a weird coincidence. Why would an underground child sex ring cover use a fucking ""pedophilia logo"" as its *own* logo. Numerous times.

All in all - there's absolutely zero proof of anything, and the amount that it was ""hyped up"" was just too much. It lead to people become **deeply** impassioned, and CONVINCED there was a serious, horrible thing going on. People thought these individuals were all disgusting, horrible criminals who rape children. Then you get a guy walking into the establishment and firing a shot.

Like I said - they seem weird, there is a couple of weird coincidences, but if you're looking for it, you can make a lot of shit sound weird.

The other side of the aisle could just as easily say ""What if Russia was a part of this - what if this was propaganda pushed by some Russian acting to distract the left/hype the right up against Hillary and her supporters?""

It's just as silly, because there's been no concrete evidence released as such, but someone could easily come to that conclusion based on random coincidences/shit they dig up online, too.",politics,t2_aeqwd,5iarhr,db7xjzt,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/db7xjzt/,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/

Ethics : How should we live? What is good or just or virtuous? How do we know?

Reason : Logic. What is a valid argument? What is rationality? What are good methods for inquiries? What are valid rules of inference. What makes a proposition true?

It is my understanding that this is what led to the so-called ""Cartesian anxiety."" 

That's not the *cogito* ""boiled down."" That's just what it is. But that's not the totality of Descartes' (the c is not capitalized) philosophy. Descartes' methodological doubt is only for the project of building a system of knowledge from undeniable truths. Descartes also cites the idea of God as equally given and undeniable and uses that to rebuild confidence in the senses. Descartes was no solipsist nor did he think the world was an illusion. You're half-knowledge of Descartes is a disservice.

That's a simulated world, especially if you imagine how easily the shadows could be intentionally misleading shadow puppetry rather than shadows of actual events outside the cave. Only by being taken outside of the cave (the simulation) can you see the simulation for what it is. The protagonist of the allegory is mocked when he tries to explain what he's seen, leading pretty much directly to the famous line from the Matrix ""Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.""

Plato's allegory is one about the relationship between universal truths, popular opinion, and the role of the philosopher.

Edit: And I disagree that they weren't forced to work there, just not in the way that you mean it. So let's tell a little story:


A child in the United States grows up being told that they can be and do whatever they want to when they get older. For the people that work at SpaceX now, I'm sure that they think this especially true. They probably had a dream that when they grew up they were going to work on rockets, and goddammit they made it come true. 

They start to find though that on this journey to build rockets, they need to 'pay their dues' so to speak. These dues involve going to college so you can gain the skills to work on rockets. The problem is that since this is a highly technical degree and field, you need to do your best to get into a good college. This isn't hard for a person who works at SpaceX to do because they have a dream. 


So they get the good marks, to get into a good school, and leave with a very high GPA (and a little bit of debt, but not too much). So they finally get an interview at SpaceX (or Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google, doesn't matter, this story works for them) and lo and behold, they impress the interviewer enough that eventually a job is offered. So now they have finally achieved their dream of working on rockets (and seriously, good for them). So all is well and the story ends happily ever after. Or does it.


Perhaps the 70 hour weeks and working weekends starts to take their toll. Their relationships outside of work begin to suffer as does their home life in general. Thank god their still at their dream job though. They don't mind working the best hours of the day, for the best years of their life, because their doing what they love. And I'm sure that Elon is right there with them earning his place in their hearts. Although ironically, it seems like most of the engineers on SpaceX have Ph.D's (and he doesn't), so even though he's right there with them, he's going to get all the money from their hard work, and maybe that's why they get out after two years because they realize it isn't fair. This is how it works at those big corporations. 



So the point of this story is that there is something that guides our actions in the life, Adam Smith calls it the invisible hand, simple proof that we don't have as much free will as we pretend we do.

So the argument he's making is that our perception of objects is lower than the ""idea"" of them. What you need to do in order to understand the allegory of the cave, is to also read the analogy of the divided line, and the analogy of the sun. The three are simply metaphors to illuminate a distinction between types of knowledge, and is not really comparable to the brain-in-a-vat case. As so--what pointed out, it has to do with Plato's theory of forms. It has a very specific applicability, and using it for other things is a misrepresentations.

The brain in a vat case has to do with, in the original formulation, what happens to our conception of knowledge when our perception is entirely identical, but nonetheless untrue. IE: if we were a brain in a vat, we would not have access to the truth about a perceived world (as it would simply be simulated), but would not be able to distinguish this from a world in which we weren't. So this has to do with a possible issue for whether perception yields knowledge (justified true belief), and there is a vast amount of literature in the field of epistemology dealing with this particular problem. There is also a vast amount of literature on whether we ought to think of knowledge as justified true belief in the first place.

Elon Musk seems to have heard the idea of our being a brain in a vat (aka he probably watched the Matrix), but has not attempted to rationally engage with this idea in the slightest. There is additionally no scientific basis for this claim in the first place, it's a philosophical thought experiment designed to test whether or not we'd consider something untrue knowledge, and what this tells us about what knowledge means. I'm not really an epistemologist so this is sort of going off what I remember and know about it. I am likely wrong in some aspects, but I am certainly more correct than you are.

And before someone gives me some shit about me being a better person than so--what for explaining this, I completely sympathise with him not wanting to explain this for the 100th time, despite some pretty easy-to-read literature being available.

I tend to be rather progressive (although I've been convinced by some conservative discussions I've had), but I tend to look at what incentives people have to behave the way they do.

Instead, I would rather have a government agency (with all of its inefficiencies even), make decisions based on their budget. They have no incentive to not provide medical care.

Yes, Wittgenstein maintains that sensations, like pain, are private and that we can never verify if one's sensation of pain with the same as another's. But your reading is wrong as Wittgenstein goes further, using his beetle-in-the-box thought experiment, to say that a word like ""pain"" doesn't get its meaning from reference to a private sensation of pain or another's private sensation of the same. The word ""pain"" gets its meaning from how it is used. If you told me ""I'm in pain,"" I wouldn't nod in understanding and say something like ""I, too, have had that sensation."" It tells me just enough about the sensation, as distinct from others, to follow the implicit rules of the language game, i.e. I would ask you where or offer to get some pain reliever.

You said again you don't trust *my* news sources, so I ask you again, what news sources do you trust? Primary sources are not the same as news sources, just so we are clear. A court document for example is not a news source, a quote is not a news source.

I sincerely doubt you don't read/trust *any* news sources. You would be almost entirely unique and would be spending nearly all your time digging for primary sources since they are fairly hard to actually come by. This is actually why reporters are such a valuable thing in society.

The bias you are worried about is of course real from outlet to outlet, which is why the best advice you can give to anyone is to get your news from as many and as varied sources as possible. The Mainstream Media is not a mega-conglomerate with a singular hive mind but a bunch of individual fiefdoms with their own goals, thoughts, and biases. By sampling from them collectively you can drown out most of the bias in the balance.

Recently it has become popular for people to accuse the mainstream media of bias, but in practice what it is is a tactic to ignore things they don't like or don't agree with their beliefs. I mean really this has been going on for quite a while, but it's been amped up recently.

Bias is real, nobody is denying that, but there are ways to avoid and deal with bias without having to reject the real, and hard work actual reporters are doing.

> What hasn't been mentioned is that the Many Worlds Interpretation is not similar either, which should be obvious by now.

I disagree here.  I'm not saying Musk's reasoning is as good as MWI or based on MWI, please don't think that.  My understanding of Musk's position is from this quote:

> I think here's the strongest argument for us being in a simulation- probably being in a simulation, i think is the following: that 40, call it 40 years ago, we had Pong. Two rectangles and a dot. That was what games were. Now, 40 years later, we have photorealistic, 3D, simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously, and it's getting better every year. And soon we%u2019ll have virtual reality, have augmented reality. If you assume any rate of improvement at all then the games will become indistinguishable from reality. They'll be indistinguishable. Even if that rate of advancement drops by a thousand from what it is right now. Then you just say okay let's imagine it's ten thousand years in the future, which is nothing in the evolutionary scale. So given that we're clearly on a trajectory to have games that are indistinguishable from reality and those games could be played on any set-top box or on a PC or whatever, and there would probably be, you know, billions of such computers or set-top boxes it would seem to follow that the odds that we're in base reality is one in billions. Tell me what's wrong with that argument.

So, basically Musk asserts that there are more places-indistinguishable-from-reality where we are a simulation than we are real.  That's sort of like the way that MWI argues against the anthropic principle - there's more realities-incompatible-with-sentience than realities-compatible-with-sentience.",politics,t2_aeqwd,5iarhr,db73nya,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/db73nya/,/r/politics/comments/5iarhr/trump_names_elon_musk_uber_ceo_to_advisory_team/

Suppose we make games that are indistinguishable from reality. The relevant question is not what this says about us, but the question ought to be: Could we create a game that plays itself, which includes people who are simulated to the point of being exactly like us, and could they discover that they were in fact being simulated? How? Could they do it without being given the ability to discover their own simulation, by those in charge of the simulation? How would they, according to their own developed criteria, determine that they were being simulated? Would we buy that explanation? Or to put it differently, the fact that we can simulate ourselves does not in fact prove whether or not we're simulated - The simulation could include the possibility of our simulating ourselves, and the limit of our knowledge could be recreating our own reality.

You see what I mean? It's per definition impossible to reach any knowledge about whether or not we're simulated, we can only ascertain that it's possible, and that if it were true, our reality would be indistinguishable from one where it isn't. It's most helpful as an epistemological idea, not a metaphysical one. We would need to create a simulation of reality which we could not identify as a simulation in order for this to work, aka., part of the notion of simulated reality is that we are unable to know whether or not it is in fact simulated. Suppose we, like in The Matrix, wake up in the ""reality"", how would we then come to know that this reality is not also a simulation? We can't. It's also pointless to do, I have no clue why he's entertaining this idea in the first place, outside of thinking it would be cool.

I think additionally, this notion that we can endlessly progress is a bit speculative as well. I don't think these simulations I'm creating are possible, at least outside of an argument from a radical solipsism, which is kinda unhelpful. Suppose the scientists do create a simulation that we somehow forget was a simulation, and we all end up inside of it, completely forgetting, after multiple generations, that it was even a simulation. What then? Could we get out of this simulation? I don't know that this whole scenario is even possible, and no one does. Assuming infinite linear progression of technology is very speculative, and needs to be defended in the first place.

What does a ""video game indistinguishable from reality"" mean? What does it look like? How does it operate? Do we get some sort of implant? Then the implant could be removed. Do we go the way of cybernetic enhancement? Are we then simulating our reality, or extending the definition of what our reality includes, and the problem sketched before still stands. We can't know anything about our ""simulatedness"", because it's epistemologically inaccessible and suffers from the possibility of an infinite regress.

By sampling wide the bias's of left leaning groups get balanced by right leaning groups.

What you're doing instead if rejecting every source because they are individually biased, looking for primary sources on your own (of which I doubt you really find that many, because as mentioned they are REALLY hard to find on most topics), and then flying blind.

> ...could they discover that they were in fact being simulated? Could they do it without being given the ability to discover their own simulation, by those in charge of the simulation? 

Well, we know very well that code can be used in ways other than how the coders intend.  SQL injection and rooting your android phone by means of an exploit are two great examples.  So I don't think there's any reason to assume that a simulation that under normal circumstances is indistinguishable from reality might couldn't fall to intense scrutiny.

Those are examples of intervention into your phone. The phone has the potential for this to happen, it's part of the existing code. This is not a counterexample, a counterexample would require some sort of machine-learning that goes beyond it's own programmed capacity, aka self-determination, or transcending it's own conditions. But if you write in a fail-safe against the simulation discovering that it is in fact simulated, then it's not possible for that to happen.

>I'm not so sure about that being settled. I don't know what the current state of science says, but here's an older conversation on the subject called When does the universe compute?. Here's a Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article. 

I'm not arguing for or against whether the universe is computational. There's a difference between something being a simulation (that requires that someone is behind the simulation) and something performing computations or working in a computational fashion. That's a different discussion.

>I can tell you that even with fairly low resolution graphics there are terrifyingly wonderful moments when I forget that I'm in my living room. 

Doesn't really matter, you can still take the Vive off, right? Like the fact that we can simulate our reality is still not evidence that we're simulated.

>In addition, **the blueprint cuts $900 million from the Office of Science**, which runs ten of the DOE’s seventeen national laboratories. The laboratories carry out a wide range of research, from sequencing for the original Human Genome Project to current fusion energy research.

>The Environmental Protection Agency is, unsurprisingly given everything Trump said during the campaign, the biggest target. **The blueprint lays out the EPA’s budget as $5.7 billion, effectively a 31 percent cut**. It will eliminate the Clean Power Plan, President Obama’s flagship policy for lowering carbon emissions.

>But that’s not all. **The budget eliminates a full 50 programs the administration deems “lower priority and poorly performing,” including Energy Star (which sets standards for energy-efficient household appliances) and the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (which addresses chemicals like BPA). The Superfund program will get 30 percent less funding for cleanup of hazardous waste sites.**

>Earth science will also lose major funding resources from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA. **The plan eliminates $250 million in funding for NOAA, which would cut grants supporting coastal and ocean research. It also cuts $102 million from NASA’s Earth science program and ends four missions that would have observed the Earth from space: PACE, OCO-3, DSCOVR Earth-viewing instruments, and CLARREO Pathfinder.**

>...

>In Trump’s overall budget, defense spending is the bigger winner with an increase of $52 billion. The blueprint does not mention funding for military science research programs, such as DARPA.

Tesla sells tens of thousands of cars but has a market cap worth 75% of General Motors. GM sells millions of cars. If it wasn't for the safety net of government aide tesla wouldn't be an attractive investment for investors speculating on the future potential. 

One wrong exchange with the president and funding can be cut and tesla and solar city lose immense market cap and ability to raise capital. Musk knows it's worth working with a president he doesn't share many views with if it can keep the electric car and solar energy industries moving forward.

This is similar to what W did.  We threw away a lot of money on his Mars mission- how much new stuff did we learn?  There isn't enough budgeted here to actually make progress on the technology to put people in space, or do do anything useful or sustainable once there.

Why was earth science important?  It was a low hanging fruit for technology development.  It's a lot easier to test a new technology in a $50 million dollar climate satellite than a $2 billion dollar mission.  NASA has always used earth sciences and the ISS as a way to justify developing this new technology.

The amount it spends on those is a drop in the bucket compared to anything that is going to involve human space flight to Mars.  By putting stuff in earth orbit you get radiation hardness data, long term solar data, etc.

Now the money from the internal cuts is not significant,  NASA is currently working on a Rover for that so the money from the cuts can help with that Rover, but not enough to launch a second rover or significantly change anything about the one they are currently making. 

Any notion of a manned mission to mars is completely out of the question with the current funding set. 


Under Obama, NASA's budget went from 17.8 billion  to 19.3 billion, Under Bush it went from 14 to 17, Similar budget increases as this every year,   Maintaining the status Quo of the last two presidents isn't that amazing.

While the proposed budget does cut the ARM mission which would redirect or capture and bring back a section of asteroid to cis-lunar space, NASA is still pursuing missions that lay out the first chapter of asteroid mining with:

* OSIRIS-REx (New Frontiers class mission actively en route to target asteroid where it will collect a sample of surface regolith to the Earth for further study)
*  Lucy (Discovery class mission that was just awarded which will explore multiple Jupiter Trojan asteroids)
* Psyche (another Discovery class mission that was just awarded that will explore a metallic asteroid).
 

However, ARM would have been a very great capstone to the first chapter of asteroid exploration and would have been the perfect segue into actual asteroid mining. I do hope congress pushes back on this as ARM would have been a Flagship class mission which would be a catalyst for a lot of new and groundbreaking technology that the private space industry that Trump likes to talk about so much could have benefited from.",politics,t2_dfafj,60u7lv,dfaq1zi,/r/politics/comments/60u7lv/elon_musk_slams_donald_trumps_nasa_bill_saying_it/dfaq1zi/,/r/politics/comments/60u7lv/elon_musk_slams_donald_trumps_nasa_bill_saying_it/

This reflects a very naive worldview. He never ""stayed away from politics"", because politics has the power of life or death over his ventures. He was always heavily involved, as he should be.

And (I say this as a huge fan of Musk and everything he's done) he was never ""independent"". Tesla depended on the Obama adminstration's loans and credits towards alternative energy. SpaceX wouldn't exist without contracts from NASA. Which isn't a criticism of Musk; just the opposite, in fact. Tesla paid back its loan to the Federal Government with interest, and it has worked hard to make good on its obligations to NASA. These are good deals for everyone all around.

'He did not know technology. He wanted to be important, and the important people are always the business people. So that’s what he wanted to do.'


That said, other at Apple  claim that Jobs understood the Apple computer's workings, had strong opinions about technical details, and helped hand manufacture and debug its first roll out.

It would be much cheaper to put a mining operation on an asteroid.  Live in the tunnels , expand as the operation progresses.   All the slag gets used to insulate surface facilities and the catapult doesn't have to be as big.

I've been reading that a good part of the challenge is in finding a rock that is large enough to provide space for a good-sized mining operation, is in an orbit that is not too inconvenient or hazardous, and which is not spinning too rapidly.  Something about 10km dia. would be ideal.  Low surface gravity means you could scoop up rock all over the surface and literally throw loads of ore to a processing plant in synchronous orbit.   With something like a hydraulic trebuchet with bags full of rocks on a line beside it.  Microgravity reduces the energy requirements for materials handling by rather a lot.

I would agree that's likely, but we don't know that Musk's intentions align with this. It's possible he really did ""sell out""  as some people in this thread have suggested.  Considering he has made statements opposing Trump's views which has been a political death sentence for other Trump associates,  coupled with his past history of pushing for good causes like solar energy,  electric cars and space travel,  I find this highly unlikely. Perhaps instead he fears Trump will attack his businesses and his progressive causes and hopes to avoid this by cozying up to Trump.  I'd say this is slightly more plausible,  but  he has faced more than his share of resistance before and shown he is not afraid of opposition even against unfavorable odds,  so I find this unlikely as well. Maybe his true reason for working with Trump is that he sees Trump's positions a threat to everything he's worked for, but rather than simply saying ""Fuck you!""  he feels the best way to prevent this is by working directly with Trump in an attempt to change his views at the source?  Considering he basically said as much in respect to the Muslim ban I think this is possible.  You might think he's wasting his time but can you really fault the man for trying?  Considering how successful he's been in his endeavors so far I think if anyone has a chance it's him. Until we see what he does though this is all speculation. But considering that all he has really done so far was not tell Trump to fuck himself,  I think it's a bit early to treat him as if he were basically Steve Bannon.

I don't think a lot of people actually believe that Elon is anywhere close to being listed to beyond the liberal definition that Trump's earballs hear words from Elon's face.

>All this does is help Trump gain credibility. Trump knows he can just ignore Elon and having the public think Elon is ""advising him"" makes him look better. 

Not that he has any credibility banked up from liberals to begin with. If there is any credibility to be gained by, Trump would first have to actually take Elon's advisement and roll with it. Trump looks no better in the eyes of the average liberal just because he talks to Elon than he did before talking to Elon. Trump could sit down for dinner with Lady Ga Ga, that doesn't mean her ""little Monsters"" are going to reelect Trump in 2020.

> Elon fell for it. I'm surprised someone as smart as Elon doesn't see what Trump is trying to do here.

Elon hasn't fallen for shit (though I would say that maybe you have). He's doing his civic duty as a citizen of this nation who he imigrated to and became a citizen of. He has a vested interest in this nations success. If I were him and had the opportunity to talk to the POTUS, if I had the chance I'd do the same in a heartbeat no matter what the political affiliation.

He's being very smart IMO, he's doing what many people have wanted to see from Silicon Valley for a long time. It's a hotbed of progressive nerds who are now starting to run the world with their products and it's high time someone from the neighborhood spoke up more so than just a $100k donation here or there. If anything, this joke of an article (seriously the article can only say that 5 people canceled their orders) was written to bully Elon into giving up.

If Trump turns out to be using Elon as you would suggest, Elon will figure it out and move on with his life and continue to make more money than Trump ever will (without a lone from his dad). If/when that day comes, we can all be sure that Elon of all people will tell us.

newsflash, trump is the president, he already has credibility. he doesnt need to gain any more. this isnt election time where a meeting like this legitimizes him. The office of the president does it itself.  the best we can hope for at this point is that he'll listen to anyone with a brain. and while he might not listen to him 99 percent of the time. Theres always that 1 percent chance that he does and at this point we need to take it. that's still better than bannon and his cronies in his ear 100 percent of the time.

In Texas, which redder than red and the one red state he did lose ground in, Trump only won by 9% points compared to Romney 2012 winning by 15%.  As well, Clinton picked up 2 counties in Texas ... deep red Texas!  In the swing states Trump won, he won them all by the slimmest of margins.

Trump's win was due more, I think, to gerrymandering, voter suppression and low turn out (turn out was the lowest iirc) than to people angry that he was mocked/not taken seriously/whatever.

He's not really a great guy:

> Yes.  My God, I'm sick of the Elon Musk Spam.  I really want to start /r/enoughmuskspam.
> 
> You know what they call the only completely non-union car company in America?  Tesla.  It also, conveniently, only makes cars for rich people.  He even bought the Freemont, CA UAW union hall just to shut it down and use it for non-union purposes.  Pretty much just as a middle finger to the UAW for trying to unionize the Tesla plant.
> 
> Oh, and you know SolarCity, the company that uses Chinese solar panels, runs finance/lease scams on homeowners to gobble up tax credit dollars?  It's number 1 competitor is IBEW union workers who live in your local neighborhood and install American-made panels and pay a good wage and offer their employees benefits.  Even the small businessman contractor using non-union labor is almost definitely paying more and getting more qualified staff than solar city.  And at least then you're supporting a local small business instead of a far off billionaire.
> 
> Meanwhile, he laid hundreds of SpaceX employees off with no warning whatsoever, and others [are suing over labor law violations.](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-spacex-employees-lawsuit-20140811-story.html)
> 
> I mean, this guy really treats his employees like absolute shit, makes billions off giving them no union access, minimal health coverage, and paying them below prevailing wages, and everyone just cheerleads for him because he has a good Tony Stark PR schtick going on...
> 
> For chrissakes, he went to the swankiest boarding school in South Africa (whites only forever), then straight to the Ivy Leagues in the US (UPenn), got a business degree at Wharton, then started an MBA, dropped out, and lucked his way into PayPal billions by winning the startup stock option buy-out lottery in the internet 1.0 bubble.
> 
> But somehow he wants us to believe he's an electrical engineer (with no experience), a rocket scientist (with no experience) a car designer (with no experience), and that he does it all himself working 100 hours per week rather than hires smart people to make him more money while he does PR stunts at Burning Man and fucks off having affairs with random women...3 filed divorces in 10 years by age 40...that's some trick.  He treats women so badly, he left his first wife he had 6 kids with (one of whom died) and called her a ""starter wife,"" when he hit the Paypal lottery.  
> 
> But people eat up the PR bullshit and worship the guy.
> 
> I really love how they spam the articles that talk about how hard he works.  How he's working 100 hours per week or whatever.  And they're impressed by that.  But, having worked a middle class desk job that commonly went 70 hours per week, I'm not impressed with that at all.  In fact, I think 100 hours as a billionaire is way easier than 70 hours as a middle class schlub.
> 
> Because Elon doesn't *have to* drive to the cleaners.  Or pick his several children up from school.  Or go to their games.  Or drive them to music lessons.  Or cook dinner.  Or go to the supermarket.  Or pay the electric bill.  Or schedule their dentist appointments.  Or go to parent/teacher conferences.  Or shovel snow.  Or mow the lawn.  Or clean the gutters.  Or rake the leaves.  Or walk the dog.  Or fix the leaky faucet.  Or do any of these things.
> 
> I mean, if *all* I had to do was my job, which I already do for 40-55 hours per week or so, and I could come home and the laundry was done and the house was clean and the kids made their way to and from all their activities on their own and had tutors making sure they did their homework and the dishes were clear and the food was prepared and ordered, and the fridge was stocked, then shit.  That's easy 5 hours per night (and more on the weekends) that would free up.  If I had a driver and didn't have to sit in traffic, that's another 10 hours per week easy freed up.  House maintenance and yard work and all that takes a lot of time too.
> 
> That's 40-50 hours of right there.  If I just spent that same time working and writing e-mails and shit, that'd be cake.
> 
> I'd be a shitty, shitty dad.  But it would be easy as hell.
> 
> Do people really believe that someone who goes from $200M to $12,000M in 10 years is anything other than greedy?
> 
> It blows my mind that people actually believe a billionaire businessman armed with nothing but a bachelor's degree and daddy's money to get into the Silicon Valley startup game in the late 90s, is really, in actuality, the world's greatest scientist and engineer all wrapped into one.
>

Not that one is right and one is wrong, just that their goals seem to be fundamentally opposed.

Now one thing I will give Trump shit for is his promoting of coal because in my opinion it is an awful energy source and is only being promoted to appeal to coal miners who think they will be getting good jobs back. In my opinion this is dishonest because it is a dying energy source and as such he is misleading voters into thinking they will have job security when in reality it will be replaced by market forces regardless at which point they will be out of a job again. So instead of focusing on replacing these jobs with better ones he's planning to harm the environment and spend taxpayer money to force us into using a sub-optimal energy source in order to appeal to a relatively small portion of the country by offering them jobs whose days are numbered.

If Trump really wanted to convince me he cared about energy he would vastly increase funding for research into fusion. Just like you said for fossil fuels it will happen either here or overseas. Do you  want China to be the ones who develop the energy source of the future while we're expanding our use of crude and inefficient fuel sources of the past?

Now based on the article the laws themselves seem somewhat unreasonable in my opinion and I don't think failing to pay employees two months salary to let them go is quite the same as treating employees ""like absolute shit,"" (if I were fired I would be escorted out of the building immediately like a criminal, although I understand this is in relation to mass-layoffs and is not quite the same thing) but the law is the law and if he did not agree then he should not have started a business there. Also it seems he is a poor family man to say the least although without evidence I am basing this off your word alone.

However other points seem to be very biased and misleading. For example this seems to suggest that Tesla sells expensive cars because Musk only wants to sell cars to rich people and snuffs poor people out of spite? This is absolutely ridiculous because it is well known that their plan is to eventually sell affordable electric cars to everyone. Did you really expect that they would be able to compete in the sub-compact market right off the bat against automotive giants who have been in business for over a century and have orders of magnitude greater manufacturing capabilities? Cheaper cars such as sub-compacts are produced with extremely tight margins and thus companies can only break even with large scale manufacturing, let alone make enough of a profit to reinvest in the R&D required for Tesla to continue to develop their electric car technology.

Also a lot of this seems to be taking personal issue with the amount of money he has as opposed to actual character flaws. I don't see how where he went to school as a kid and young adult is relevant to whether or not he is a decent person, and I also don't see how him *only* working 100 hours a week makes him a scumbag.

Working for Elon Musk would never be a walk in the park - because of what he and his employees are trying to accomplish. I read his biography, and it spoke about all the pressure he put his employees under when trying to make SpaceX happen. Working for him is not for the faint of heart.

He used to interview everyone that was about to work for him, including janitors. He wanted to personally make sure they understood what hard work really was, and if they could handle it. I can't imagine anyone applying to SpaceX or Tesla all willy nilly without having some understanding of what they are getting themselves into.

I agree, SpaceX can't be ostracized but Trump is 100% going to be claiming he's environmentally friendly and will drag Tesla and Musk out in tweets and speeches like he does Omarosa.

He is not interested in green tech, where the fuck is the money for him? Is he getting Tesla shares? Trump partakes in nothing in which he does not share in profit or personal satisfaction. What's good for the country is not even remotely in consideration. 

SpaceX is very important but climate change is an existential threat to our civilization. Plenty of Trump voters fully support funding space science yet completely do not believe in climate change, this is the crowd that thinks NASA shouldn't study planetary science. Because that makes a lick of sense, but that's a Trump voter for you. Everything is half-baked.

He will gut green tech, 100%. He is in the pocket of oil. If he wants to gut space funding, he has everyone to answer for.

Even then, there're tons of paperwork, lengthy wait for approval, complete switch on the agency's goal whenever there's new president, etc.  SpaceX, for example, has a much more lean organization that encourage quick iteration and new ideas.  Both approaches have thier pros and cons.  NASA is less focus but has more general expertise.  SpaceX has less general expertise but is more focus.  There're lot of things that NASA can do but SpaceX can't, space stations, deep space probes, etc.  However SpaceX has proved that they are one of the best at having things done cheaply.  Some estimates that some of SpaceX projects would cost 10x more if run by NASA due to stuffs like bureaucracy (I'm looking at you, space shuttles).

Also, NASA is SpaceX biggest customer, but not their sole source of income.  SpaceX currently has a backlog of satellite launch contract for the good next 3-4 years.

NASA also never or very rarely build stuffs themselves.  They usually contract companies to do that for them.  The Saturn V, for example, was manufactured by Boeing, North American, and Douglas.  NASA specifies requirements and those companies propose designs with varying costs in a process known as cost-plus contract which tends to result in prohibitively expensive project.

There are many people that would prefer trump to *try* to be Hitler.  They trust that there are checks and balances, but they're not as strong as they should be.  It's a ""shoot the moon"" stunt -- trump could pretty easily consolidate power and do a ton of damage to just about everything imaginable.  However, if he goes hard fascist fast enough, before the country has sufficiently been acclimated to it -- enough to alienate *everyone*, it means he won't be able to accomplish anything.  Of course, trump's impeachment would leave us with Pence, so we're kinda screwed anyway.  Still, I can understand people who want this to be over itching for the showdown to happen ASAP.

For a ""success"" story, look to Erdogan.  Fifteen years ago, he got great popular support for making Turkey great again, and slowly consolidated power, until he had the support and position to fully take over.  Similarly, this is what spooks have been doing for a while: break the law without anyone noticing, until it's ""normal"", then change the law to match the new reality.",politics,t2_bmry7,5ri1xg,dd7vayb,/r/politics/comments/5ri1xg/people_are_canceling_tesla_orders_because_elon/dd7vayb/,/r/politics/comments/5ri1xg/people_are_canceling_tesla_orders_because_elon/

It's the 21st century. We don't need traditional values anymore. We need to collectivize and institute communism if we want to survive climate change and automation. They need to be less selfish and scared of taxes and less obsessed with ""freedom"". We need to stop valuing living solely to work, especially when automation is going to take most jobs. The world is changing drastically and these fuckheads are keeping us in the past. Why do people get so angry when someone tells them what is right? Ideally in the future an algorithm will decide what we spend 3-4 hours a day working, 4 days a week. One's labor shouldn't define them, their hobbies and passions should. Obamacare would've worked much better if the Medicare expansion was mandatory and the states payed their whopping 10%. Ideally it shouldn't matter who your doctor is if you get adequate care. conservatism needs to die. It's time to move forward, not backwards. We need drastic societal change, I don't understand why people are so fearful of that. Individually we are all worthless only collectivized can true greatness be achieved. Their culture needs to change. Like it or not production will continue to increase with less and less labor required. What they want and what the future holds are two very different things. We have to stop searching for life's meaning in hard work. It just won't be necessary. UBI and Universal Healthcare will absolutely be required for these very same people to SURVIVE in 25 years. The existing economy of many ""single street"" towns in rural America is completely incompatible with the direction of the world, like it or not. These communities will soon be relics. It's scary, sure, and I sympathize with those in these areas, but we can't just shut our eyes and do nothing forever. Automation will decimate the workforce and rural communities and the only way to support them will be widespread redistribution of production and social services. Automated trucking alone will replace 7% of all workers, and many rural communities rely on truckers to support their businesses. Shits going to hit the fan buddy. Automation will reduce the necessary labor hours to reach the same gdp drastically and without a communally oriented social and economic system mass amounts of people will be subject to joblessness and poverty. Rural Americas days are numbered and that's a good thing. Conservative values on family and hard work are toxic to progressing into the 21st century

3881,MyNameIsRay,https://electrek.co/2016/11/22/elon-musk-right-wing-trump-propaganda-campaign-against-tesla-spacex/,"Trump has vowed to cut back or remove many of the incentives that Tesla/SpaceX takes advantage of. This includes R&D grants that have helped develop essential technology, like lithium ion batteries, that make his products possible in the first place.

His importation tax might also be killer. For instance, almost all the world's lithium comes from South America, and many of the basic electrical components come from China. If these things were suddenly 35-45% more expensive, that could have quite the impact. Also worth noting, tariffs are usually answered with tariffs, which would make it far more difficult for Tesla to sell outside of the US.

I might be naive, but it really does seem like they're trying to drive production out of the US. What incentive does he have to stay in the US if all these roadblocks and speed bumps are put in place?",politics,t2_n2fh0,5eazfh,dacjarm,/r/politics/comments/5eazfh/rightwing_group_led_by_trump_propagandist/dacjarm/,/r/politics/comments/5eazfh/rightwing_group_led_by_trump_propagandist/

Then they can do any evil shit they want so long as their image holds up.  If you refuse to research topics and stances and go only by appearance,  you're fucking stupid.  Those people react to emotion so when conservative media first reassure their beliefs then get mad over something the listener should actually be glad about, they react how ther idols do. That's been going on for long enough that people who need social services vote to eliminate them.  They don't think of their votes harming them because they get their opinions from people they incorrectly feel are just like them and simultaneously from people who are like them but who get their opinions from pretenders.  So I wouldn't say it's them wanting to burn everything down instead of mob mentality.",politics,t2_n2fh0,5eazfh,dac77po,/r/politics/comments/5eazfh/rightwing_group_led_by_trump_propagandist/dac77po/,/r/politics/comments/5eazfh/rightwing_group_led_by_trump_propagandist/

No he couldn't.  ITAR would prevent it.

As for the other stuff, he also has obligations to meet with the gigafactory from the deal Tesla made with Nevada.  And Tesla bought a huge automotive plant from Toyota that they couldn't just stop expanding into without basically throwing away that capital.

Maybe they could lease out the remaining portion of it?  I don't think they would get good terms on that.

After Karl Popper's *The Open Society and Its Enemies* (1945, a defense of liberal democracies then fighting fascism, and soon communism), he named his charitable organization the Open Society Institute, and started out in 1984 by sending photocopiers to universities, libraries, and democracy groups behind the Iron Curtain in 1984. If you know the history of the fall of the Soviet empire, you'll know that these were a huge deal at the time, breaking the regimes' monopoly on information. And Eastern Europe was Soro's focus for most of the 80s and 90s - grants to universities, to aid civilians during the siege of Sarajevo etc. All things anyone sane could get behind.

Some things were more controversial, Open Society supported pro-democracy movements in the Color Revolutions in Yugoslavia, Georgia, and Ukraine in the mid-2000s, sort of an NGO adjunct to U.S. foreign policy of the time, which the Left wasn't pleased with.

Where the Right turned on him is that he also started spending money on AIDS campaigns, LGBT rights groups, drug legalization campaigns, Palestinian groups under Israeli occupation, and opposition to GWB's reelection in 2004.

No. People are considered more conservative as they get older. For the most part, they don't actually change their views. People don't become conservative so much as younger generations become more liberal.

Somebody who was a 20 year old liberal in 1888 might have thought it was the right thing for black men to be allowed vote. Then, when he's 50 years old, he would have been considered conservative because he didn't believe women should vote. He didn't stop thinking black men should vote, or change his views, it's just that women weren't included in the fight for voting rights before.

Or a 20 year old liberal in 1965 might have fought against segregation and for Civil Rights. By the time they are retirement aged, Gay Rights is the new Civil Rights battlefield and they are opposed to it.

This is false. Given that republicans controlled both chambers of congress and [even a majority of democrats at the time](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2008/05/29/the-pact-between-bill-clinton-and-newt-gingrich) favored some form of partial privatization options the policy was considered but never fought for.

[Hillary has always been to Bill's left on domestic issues.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/) 

>the Treasury Secretary Hillary was floating (Tony James of Blackstone) has been very publicly in favor of a Wall Street privatization of Social Security for some time now

This is just made up fake news. Not surprised you take it seriously. And the treasury secretary means dick for privatizing social security, congress has to do that. 

>The left doesn't like the Clintons because they are not left, they are more center-right than anything

Bill was far more of a centrist than Hillary. Hillary has [always been more liberal](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/). She also ran on without question the most liberal political campaign platform in US history. And it will help win the popular vote by over 2 million because she dominated liberal states like CA and NY full of cosmopolitan liberals, but she hemorrhaged fly over states where old boring white people who despise liberals decided the election.

4539,Saffuran,https://electrek.co/2016/11/22/elon-musk-right-wing-trump-propaganda-campaign-against-tesla-spacex/,"You cannot just say ""this is false"" as you said both chambers of congress were controlled by Republicans AND that a majority of democrats favored such policy, you can't say that something with that much backing and that much money behind it was ""considered but never fought for"" because conceptually within politics that makes absolutely no sense to suggest. The privatization of Social Security also fell in line with Bill's tendencies to gut components of FDR's New Deal and legislation that supported it, deregulating the banks via the repeal of Glass-Steagall and his union busting antics central to that argument, you have the track record of ""accomplishments"" to create the precedent. As for the Tony James link, you can call it fake all you want but that is just not truthful, as for the position of secretary, he would still be in the Clinton's ear as part of her cabinet and it is very much a symbolic gesture of approval of that sort of fiscal/economic view as much as Trump's appointment of Bannon is a full on embrace of the reactionary Alt-Right. 

Effectively people felt like they were going to probably get screwed on Social Security by either candidate so that is not a choice, and if you make the choice ""protect social security for people in their 50s and sucks to be you"" for anyone under whatever cutoff they establish, those people will revolt at the polls, and in large part it seems like they did in places where it mattered.

To give your argument a fair shake I do agree that what the Clintons did, mostly due to Hillary's push, for universal healthcare was admirable and at the very least a great start to get the ball rolling on accomplishing something real that still needs to be achieved today, if only for the efficiency of the system due to the fact that private insurance ESPECIALLY health insurance is one of the most bloated albatrosses on a US citizen and the strictly for profit nature of the industry is borderline unethical/immoral while having almost all of the wrong priorities due to that structure. Universal Healthcare, through a full expansion of Medicare/Medicaid (as was the original intention) to cover all citizens is ideal. That is something the Clinton's did legitimately fight for and it's a shame that today Hillary is more ""pragmatic"" and unbelieving in the ability to accomplish that goal. That ""pragmatism"" as her supporters like to call it certainly didn't galvanize voter support.

And lets not forget that the only reason why the ""most liberal political campaign platform"" only came about in large part due to the Sanders coalition of voters & surrogates pushing that platform to the left by force as hard as possible. A political platform that Hillary barely even spoke of through her entire campaign as her focus was ""I'm with Her"" and vague pluralities like ""we're stronger together"" and ""I'm not Donald Trump"" she didn't run an issue oriented campaign (no emphasis on climate change, no word on Social Security or the TPP, no rallying policies) she just ran an ""I'm not him, vote for the first woman president"" identity politics campaign and in the end was ultimately trying to look like President Obama's third term by proxy. The truth is that people are in fact hurting and they have been for some time, and if you run on a platform that say ""things will be okay, we're staying the course"" when people have been in a funk for 10, 20, or 30 years they don't want the same corporate crony capitalistic anti-union bullshit because they're tired of it. Whether or not that would have been the case doesn't matter because perception is everything and Hillary is literally THE WORST messenger for populist left wing change the Democratic party could have offered.

Clinton was always fighting an uphill battle, Trump is part of a global economic populist wave that is rejecting the predatory capitalism of the western world. Britian felt it with Corbyn's rise as well as the Tories taking charge of the government and Brexit, the Philippines (while not part of the western world) revolted as part of this movement in electing Duarte. Spain's government has been minimalized into a caretaker government with little to no real power. Italy is about to enter a constitutional crisis that could spell doom for its current government, and right wing fascists (The National Front, who are much more Nazi-like than Trump) are currently the most popular party in France and poised to take over the government there.

For the economy, personally I think the transition should be from coal/oil to nuclear then to renewables. Nuclear is a fantastic solution to this transition I think. Nuclear is held back by regulations. We have a plant in my county and we've never had an problems with it and our county is a very clean county. It also employs tons of people.. so when fossil fuel starts to run out, phase into nuclear as a bridge between fossil and renewable... renewable like solar needs so many solar panels to create enough energy for America.. nuclear can withstand the energy demand while allowing renewable energy plants to develop while falling in line with free market demands. 

On a scientific side note, allowing nuclear energy to expand would lead to more R&D into nuclear safety as well as new nuclear energy sources (like plutonium, thorium) and eventually lead to what I would say energy's ""king"", fusion energy. As you can tell I love nuclear energy and feel that should get less regulation because it's economical and can provide energy for a VERY long time.

> On Wednesday, Elon Musk - celebrity tech genius, aspiring space mogul, and Tesla chief - made a dramatic announcement: He was going to help the people of Flint, Michigan.

> Elon Musk&#039;s adoring fans - who flock to his Tweets in the hundreds, laud his successes, and even write erotica about him - typify a deeply American idolization of the wealthy.

> His announcement about Flint marked the second time in a week Musk had stepped in to a well-publicized crisis with the goal of playing savior.

a) Tesla is looking like its about to start turning profits, maybe already has.  

b) Even if Trump got rid of all tax breaks that fuel Musks business (even the ones for reducing the car price.)  The corporate tax rate he is proposing would outweigh that significantly once Tesla is profitable (it turned a profit last quarter I believe.)

c) Musk has billions in losses built up to hold against future profits (like Trump did).

I actually think Elon is going to thrive in this environment, regardless. 

Solar city is another story, and was already a loser in terms of profits,  and Musk just bailed it out.   

Just my two cents. 

If anything, a Trump environment could push renewables towards profitability faster, as a necessity.  And we know in some areas they already are profitable / more cost effective than local alternatives (coal/gas).",politics,t2_j93by,5ghgnc,das9rte,/r/politics/comments/5ghgnc/the_looming_energy_battle_between_elon_musk_and/das9rte/,/r/politics/comments/5ghgnc/the_looming_energy_battle_between_elon_musk_and/

The oil and coal companies need to start paying a fair price for the privilege of mining and selling resources that started out as property of the public on public lands. They need to pay their share of funding the military that guarantees safe shipping lanes on the seas. They need to start paying all the externalized costs associated with the pollution from extracting, shipping, and burning all those fossil fuels. They need to pay for the clean up in the many rivers that have been poisoned by coal ash. The vast amounts of mercury they've deposited across virtually every waterway.


But also tell him, if the subsidies are still in effect it would be foolish to let the government keep his tax dollars and he should use those subsidies to get his tax dollars back. All those wealthy elites are always using loopholes to avoid taxes, when the little guy gets an opportunity to stick it to the government and take their tax dollars back they had better do it quick.


And he should support free market economics by purchasing a car that will force competition between energy producers. If you buy a gasoline car your energy source is set, if you buy electric you have options to get energy from coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydro, solar, wind, biomass. The oil option places control of the markets in the hands of a few who never cease to manipulate the market. The added bonus is that the electric car will help keep gasoline prices lower by forcing the oil companies to compete in the energy market.


Tell him that if he loves America he would buy an electric car. The Tesla and Bolt are American cars, designed and manufactured in America by American companies and they use energy produced in America with American resources. Otherwise he may be getting a car that is 30% Chinese and may be burning oil from an Islamic country or from some socialist country south of the border.


My God, the closer you look at it the more it looks like anyone who doesn't buy electric is a Sharia Law Communist! /s


Seriously though, there are many valid reasons to consider an electric car.
