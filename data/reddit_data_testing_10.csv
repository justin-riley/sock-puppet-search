I had heard two different pieces on NPR. They spoke with injured workers on both shows and on one they interviewed a physician’s assistant who left because she raised concerns. She said injured workers, some who couldn’t even walk, were taken to a hospital by Uber so that the company could avoid using an ambulance, which they would need to report as an accident. NPR played back numerous calls recorded by 9-11 operators. Apparently calls are made frequently, every week. I don’t recall the exact numbers, but I believe it was more than once a week.

Then there is Musk & his fucking ridiculous hate-on for the colour yellow. In places like an auto manufacturing plant, zones where a worker could get hurt by moving machinery have to be indicated and yellow is the universal caution colour. These places will have, amongst other things, lines painted yellow on the floor as an indication of where not to walk. But Musk banned the use of the colour yellow. Fuck safety for the employees who help you maintain your wealth, right Elon? As far as I’m considered, he’s elitist scum.

Also consider that humans began domesticating dogs around 10,000 years ago, and wolves and dogs split over 30,000 years ago. Have they changed a lot since then? By appearances, yes. Then again, so have humans (by appearances), but that has really not translated directly to intelligence gains for either species.

For dogs, humans have interfered and encouraged a few specific traits, some of which *seem* to indicate higher degrees of intelligence than others. However, that’s not necessarily true. That observation might say more about what we value than about the actual mental capabilities of the animal.

More generally, I would posit that intelligence is not a spectrum at all, really, but more like a multidimensional set of abilities that allow creatures to process information and use it for survival. You can think of brains as consisting of specific modules that provide certain kinds of functionality.

What makes us “more” intelligent than some other species is not that we moved along some sliding scale over time, but that our brain consists of several types of modules, of which many other animals have a smaller subset. This gives us a lot more to work with. But the kind of evolution that could provide those features to dogs would require a lot of time, probably more than the total lifetime of our own species, which is, so far, (at most) around 200,000-300,000 years.",news,t2_c8tda,bo1csj,enbi336,/r/news/comments/bo1csj/elon_musk_to_receive_2019_stephen_hawking_medal/enbi336/,/r/news/comments/bo1csj/elon_musk_to_receive_2019_stephen_hawking_medal/

Car A and Car B take roughly the same amount of energy to build, sourced from parts all over the world, as all car manufacturing is done these days.

Car A, after being built, continues to burn fuel into even more noxious gases into the atmosphere, which must be trucked from around the world, processed, then trucked in to stations for Car A to use.

Car B, after being built, takes in electricity created by power plants near its point of charging. These power plants just so happen to be insanely more efficient than the engine in Car A. As these power plants become more renewable, the energy is more and more effective.

Regular car parts are sourced from around the world. Teslas have more car parts built in the U.S. than the majority of automakers-- partially due to the fact that they are still a smaller carmaker, not having massive production. Their batteries are produced by them and Panasonic in a joint venture, at a giant factory in the U.S. They provide more American jobs per car. They're more environmentally sound, incredibly safe-- and, more importantly, have jumped started the industry moving to electric cars, which are proven to be better for the environment.

There is some bad. Elon has made some serious missteps, such as the Thai Diver incident. The cars have caused a few deaths, by the fault of the car and not the driver.  It is likely that will happen at least a few more times.

How does this work when existing networks, radio stations, police/military, etc all already have rights to certain frequencies?

Also what technology will this actually use? Wifi doesn't have enough range to get to space, is it basically going to be cell service connecting to space? I assume that would require stronger signals than connecting to the nearest cell tower?

Yes I understand that SpaceX and most other satellite companies are required to submit an end-of-life plan (e.g. Let the objects fall toward earth and burn in the atmosphere) before launch, but what if the plan fails?

With that being said I hope they pickup some of the slack in rural area internet coverage. It's difficult to expand coverage in rural areas as a WISP. WISP's would love to buy uplinks from this system if it works well and provide additional coverage.

With fiber optic tech becoming cheaper and more efficient I struggle to see how a mesh satellite network would be better than improving the fiber backbone of international telecom.

1114,taylortyler,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/musk-on-starlink-internet-satellites-spacex-has-sufficient-capital.html,"Sounds like a bad idea:

>Repeated Wi-Fi studies show that Wi-Fi causes oxidative stress, sperm/testicular damage, neuropsychiatric effects including EEG changes, apoptosis, cellular DNA damage, endocrine changes, and calcium overload. Each of these effects are also caused by exposures to other microwave frequency EMFs, with each such effect being documented in from 10 to 16 reviews. Therefore, each of these seven EMF effects are established effects of Wi-Fi and of other microwave frequency EMFs. Each of these seven is also produced by downstream effects of the main action of such EMFs, voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) activation. While VGCC activation via EMF interaction with the VGCC voltage sensor seems to be the predominant mechanism of action of EMFs, other mechanisms appear to have minor roles. Minor roles include activation of other voltage-gated ion channels, calcium cyclotron resonance and the geomagnetic magnetoreception mechanism. Five properties of non-thermal EMF effects are discussed. These are that pulsed EMFs are, in most cases, more active than are non-pulsed EMFs; artificial EMFs are polarized and such polarized EMFs are much more active than non-polarized EMFs; dose-response curves are non-linear and non-monotone; EMF effects are often cumulative; and EMFs may impact young people more than adults. These general findings and data presented earlier on Wi-Fi effects were used to assess the Foster and Moulder (F&M) review of Wi-Fi. The F&M study claimed that there were seven important studies of Wi-Fi that each showed no effect. However, none of these were Wi-Fi studies, with each differing from genuine Wi-Fi in three distinct ways. F&M could, at most conclude that there was no statistically significant evidence of an effect. The tiny numbers studied in each of these seven F&M-linked studies show that each of them lack power to make any substantive conclusions. In conclusion, there are seven repeatedly found Wi-Fi effects which have also been shown to be caused by other similar EMF exposures. Each of the seven should be considered, therefore, as established effects of Wi-Fi.

This is going after the direct tv internet.  That is costly slow and has bandwidth issues.  This will allow you to setup base camp in Nepal and get quality 100 meg connections with around 100 to 150 ms round trips. This is more than enough for a 4K hd stream and phone calls.  I would not go competitive gaming on this system but hey if it is a mmrpg maybe. 


The system is interesting as it does not use the normal TCP / IP stack. Elon has alluded to the fact they stripped the frame down and rebuilt it to make it purpose built for this system in order to maximize throughput for each frame sent. They are trying to maximize the amount of data per frame.   


So being a network engineer who has worked with carriers I am super interested in seeing this new take on packing up the frame and sending it.  



I suspect this stuff will be amazing for fixed high speed in remote locations and used as backhaul for cellular providers during disasters.

Good news is that the biggest factor that has been preventing affordable internet was the shipping cost of the satellites. He's already cut payload cost by %90.

Recently, experts have been suggesting that, although a cascade would be very costly, it's not very likely to produce a scenario where we couldn't launch into space. 

This is mostly because we're advancing laser technology so much in the last decade alone that it's possible for us to right now build a laser that would slowly de-orbit debris by using the small off-gassing from a laser strike to create drag against the piece of debris. And we know where these pieces of debris are thanks to a global network of ground-based trackers that constantly detect debris down to the size of the head of a small bolt.

While it is possible to cut the cables, it's not like you're completely cutting off internet access to the rest of the world even if you managed to completely isolate a country by wiping their international cable network. Even if you did manage to cut all of the cables that country has connecting them internationally, the internet would still work at the same speed within the country, and most would have access to satellite and other countries undersea cables via alternate land routes. Unless we get another full-scale WW I doubt you would see much targeting of a specific countries or regions internet access, at least in developed countries.

I would think that the only effective way to knock out comms quickly and effectively in a region would be an EMP or some sort of large scale cyber attack.

1733,francis2559,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/musk-on-starlink-internet-satellites-spacex-has-sufficient-capital.html,"Good question but tldr, no.

Long version is that if you put something up very high it stays there a long time, but the lower it is the less time it stays up.

Traditionally people wanted their very expensive satellites to stay up as long as possible so they launched them deep.  They also wanted as few as possible (to save cost) so they wanted them to stay in one spot, over a large bunch of customers.  Again, geostationary orbit means deep, high, and junk stays up.

The downside is that it is so high, the speed of light factors in and latency becomes a serious issue.  It’s very annoying for real-time communication.

Musk sees an opportunity because he can launch satellites cheaply himself, many of them, and keep them very close to earth so they have low latency.  Fortunately for you, they don’t last very long and burn up quickly in the atmosphere.  So no junk.  Fortunately for Musk, he has a business that launches more satellites for the low cost of “stupid cheap.”

Since they are so low, he can’t do geostationary, they HAVE to orbit.  Since they orbit, in order to cover one area 24/7 you need many satellites taking turns.  While they are rotating away, you might as well cover everything else too.

This allows for example to set up your sat dish in a way that it just has to face the same direction all the time. 

 Low earth orbit is easier to reach. It has a lower period, that's why the ISS appears to be fast moving in the sky. Also because it is harder to send signals to the other side of the earth because it is so near and therefore covers a larger area in the line of sight (earth looks bigger because it's nearer and blocks more signal).

SpaceX isn't just saving money on retail vs wholesale launch costs and flying cheaper rockets.  They're actually getting their launch customers to pay for the rocket itself so they get it free as salvage for repetitive launches at unheard of launch costs - which are most of the constellation costs.  Plus they manufacture their own birds with an eye toward reducing cost beginning from a clean sheet of paper. Plus we have come a long way in signals processing, miniaturization, network design and so on in the last 25 years.  Plus, SpaceX has already funded the constellation to the point where it will be a profitable Enterprise, and investors are lined up to get in if the opportunity presents, so they have the money to complete their constellation and pass the profitability hurdle.

So even if each were a mile long each it wouldn’t be crowded and in reality they are closer to 50 ft in length(guessing).  

From an article addressing the crowded space:
*It’s led many aerospace experts to wonder how this might clog up the space around Earth, and raised concerns about the risks of in-flight collisions and space debris. To lower the possibility of creating debris, SpaceX has proposed moving some of its satellites to lower orbits, and it also plans to dispose of these satellites over water, where they’ll burn up almost completely in the atmosphere and not pose a threat to people or property below.*

Also space goes millions and billions of light years past earth so we will still be able to explore space as much as we please.  I just wish I could be alive in a hundred or even a  thousand years to see the technology and space exploration advancements.

And these are SpaceX launching SpaceX cargo - they might be able to afford to take more risks, as long as they announce any unusual risks beforehand, so their other customers still trust their normal flights.

2362,WhoopsyDaisyBouquet,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/musk-on-starlink-internet-satellites-spacex-has-sufficient-capital.html,"Most satellite ISPs are at a geostationary orbit at about an altitude of 27,000 miles. So let's say you just want to ping the satellite real quick and let's assume you're directly beneath it, and let's just say your packet of data will travel at the full speed of light (186,282 miles/second).

That means it would take ((27,000/186,282) x 1000) = 145ms for the satellite to receive your request and another 145ms for it to be beamed back at you (We're also assuming no hardware processing times either, I guess). So a perfectly ideal time to ping a geostationary Satellite would take 285ms.

The Starlink satellite constellation will be at a much, much lower altitude. Quick numbers I saw were between 210 and 710 miles high. Averaging that number out at 460 miles up and pinging one of these satellites would be ((460/186,282) x 1000) = about 2.4ms. So an ideal round trip would take about 4.8ms.

The speed of light is relative to the medium it is traveling through. The speed of light through the vacuum of space is faster than the speed of light through fiber optic cables.

I agree with you this won’t replace undersea cables so much as it will supplement them, but latency is absolutely not the reason. The satellite Ka and Ku band spectrum is relatively easy to jam by a malicious actor whereas a cable can’t be jammed. It takes a bit more expertise to have a submarine go cut some underseas cables.

Also, once the constellation is complete, eliminating a link will require the destruction of massive amounts of satellites. Taking out one or two will only barely slow things down as traffic will just be rerouted, and the orbital debris will quickly decay, limiting the possible damage to other nearby sats. With multiple orbital shells providing coverage, even if a number of satellites are destroyed in a Kessler cascade, there will still be operating sats above/below to take up the slack.

The important thing to remember, too, is that this constellation will be continuously evolving. Each launch of sats will likely contain new features to enhance the operation of the constellation.

Then he announced that he would send a tourist to [Moon orbit by 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-45550755) without ever even having sent a human into space, let alone have them stay for any great length of time.

Dishes are great at _hearing_ satellites, it's an entirely different problem when you want to be heard.

To be heard, you either need a highly focused low power transmitter or a high powered low focused transmitter.

If you're on the ground and you want to visually signal someone on the space station some morse code, you could either use a large wattage light array to be seen, or use a much lower wattage but highly focused laser.

If we accept a focused laser is the best approach, then we also need to tackle the other problem, that highly focused laser needs to be ON TARGET to be seen which means satellite tracking and aiming ability.

My parent's house (semi rural area on the outskirts of a city) got upgraded from 10 to 100mbps about 8 months ago, they have FTTDP, which involves fibre running to the end of their driveway and then it gets converted to VDSL2 by a small underground box which is hooked up to the phone line that runs into their house. Theoretical max speed on that is about 150-200mbps at the most, but it's capped at 100mbps for now since it's a new technology. In the future when it gets upgraded they can either swap out the underground box to something that supports higher speeds (up to 1gbps) or upgrade to full fibre by replacing the cable down their driveway. 

I live in an apartment in the inner suburbs of a different city and I put in my order to get my internet upgraded today, going from ADSL to Cable. I COULD go up to 100mbps but I'm a cheapskate and don't want to pay for more than 50mbps. Like FTTDP, the cable network can be upgraded to 1gbps in the future but for now it's limited to 100mbps. 

The problem lies with about 40-50% of the country which is connected by Fibre to the Node, essentially an optical fibre which runs to a cabinet, and from that cabinet existing phone cables are used to connect up to 450 homes in the neighbourhood. The closer you are to the cabinet, the higher speeds you get. Some people only get around 25mbps, and that network isn't due to be upgraded any time soon so they're stuck with that.

Satellite internet in Australia (which is used to connect most outback and super rural homes) isn't 'fibre speeds' but  it's relatively cheap as far as satellite goes, and provides 25mbps down, 5mbps up. The killer with that is the latency, which is about 600ms.

All those different connection methods are known as the ""Multi Technology Mix"" as part of our National Broadband Network (NBN). It was MEANT to be rolled out as FTTP to something like 90% of Australian households but our current government (who will likely be voted out tomorrow in the federal election) thought using copper would be cheaper and more efficient, fucking it up for a lot of people.",news,t2_12jlaq,bpakkx,enulmqw,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/enulmqw/,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/

3070,itsnotmythrowaway1,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/musk-on-starlink-internet-satellites-spacex-has-sufficient-capital.html,"Well...

60 of these satellites are going up on a single falcon launch. Those launches run twenty million, and the stack of satellites cost less than the launch, so let's put the whole thing at forty million.

Putting more than 11,000 of these things into orbit takes more than 180 launches at the 60-per-launch level. 7.2 billion dollars with the current launch vehicle (less with the BFR, they're saying it'll reduce costs by a factor of 5 on launch, vastly reducing the number of required launches).

Now here's the fun part. Serving the more developed, generally wealthier, and populated northern hemisphere (Europe, USA, Asia) requires far fewer satellites. Less than 20 launches overall with the current Falcon should put a viable constellation in place for those parts of the world, opening up billions of potential customers for significantly less than a billion dollars in satellite+launch costs.

And if Elon is to be believed, this constellation is going to provide internet service on par or better than anything available on the ground for the vast majority of those people. Cheap and fast internet with low pings.

Let's say ten million people sign up for service. Ten million out of billions of potential customers. Sound reasonable?

How much would you pay for such a service?

I pay $100/month for a business-class 100mb down 30 up unlimited line from Cox. I'm happy with this service, but I would -in a heartbeat- swap it out if you offered me a reliable and faster unlimited-data service at the same price.

But let's cut that in half.

At $50/month, you're talking about six billion dollars a year.

At $25/month, you're talking about three billion a year.

At $12.50/month, you're still at 1.5 billion a year. Twice the amount of money it cost to launch that first thousand satellites, and that constellation is up for five years.

Now do the math with 100 million customers... or more...

What about the other customers? How much would the US Government pay for a reliable global high speed internet connection that can be reached by boat, plane, and troops on the ground?

How much will cell phone companies pay to pop up small 5G towers all over cities, using small star-link receivers to deliver networking?

There are 4.4 billion active internet users right now. The potential market is insanely large. If SpaceX pulls this off, they're going to be offering an affordable (and very likely -faster-) alternative to their current internet service. Sure, there are places with dense populations and cheap fibre optic high speed networks already deployed, but there are billions of people who will -never- have access to that kind of networking power from terrestrial internet companies. 

Starlink could give them that. With the flip of a switch, the whole world could have genuine broadband internet access... from the most rural village to the biggest city.

Hell, let's just focus on the US alone. Ignore the big cities for a minute. 

55 million people in the US lack access to 25Mbps/3Mbps service (which is awful service). They can't get faster internet.

53% of rural Americans lack access to 25Mbps/3Mbps.

20% of rural America can't even get 4Mbps/1Mbps service.

Just in the US alone there are tens of millions of rural Americans who would leap at the chance to get decent internet at an affordable price. There's about sixteen million Americans who can't get internet at their home. How many of them will sign up?

The long and the short of it? It's a lot of money to put these satellites in that low orbit, but the return is insane. If they pull this off, the sky is literally the limit. The cost of continuing launches to maintain the constellation will be absolutely negligible against their profits.",news,t2_12jlaq,bpakkx,ens7asd,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/ens7asd/,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/

If you mean the difference between this and cell towers, well first obviously the distances are much greater (~700 mi IIRC), so you need bigger antennas and more power. 
Next the 1.0 satellites will have laser links to communicate with each other (these 0.9 sats don’t have the laser links, its unknown if they have a slower radio link). 
Next since these sats are in LEO, the full constellation should be able to provide global coverage, meaning that people in the middle of the pacific should be able to get better internet than most of us have now.
The early plan is not for you and me to mount a pizza box directly on our roof, but to give such antennas to existing or new providers in regions where infrastructure is crappy or non existent so that they can provide last mile connectivity (cell towers, wifi, etc.). When the laser link sats are sent up the latencies should in theory be *lower* than traditional networks over land since laser light traveling through space travels faster than laser light in fiber optic cables, and possibly fewer stops along the way. This would mean that financial institutions would pay through the nose for such an advantage over the peers.

There is absolutely no precedent of that ever occurring.  
  
So how does that make it a PR stunt?   
  
> Telling people you are going to launch 12,000(!) satellites before even one rocket has been launched is the definition of courting publicity. And again, a precedent has been set by this man for making outlandish assertions.  
  
What number are they supposed to say? That's the end goal. Are they supposed to say they're just launching 100, or maybe 150,000? 11,943 is the number in the FCC filing, which is why you're seeing it everywhere. I don't even think Musk himself has ever said the exact number of satellites they plan on launching. This number being thrown around was just taken from an FCC filing, which they definitely didn't publicize.    
  
You're acting like SpaceX has been making a huge deal out of this Starlink thing, when it reality they've kept it pretty much completely under wraps until recently. This project has existed for years and SpaceX only very recently publicly acknowledged it.  
  
Even so, they're not even the only ones working on this kind of thing. OneWeb raised billions to do the same thing, and very recently launched their own set of test satellites, with plans to launch thousands more. I think there might be a few other companies in this game as well.  
   
> What was it again?  
  
I'm aware that Musk gives unrealistic timelines (hence the ""elon time"" meme), but he seems to be better at delivering on this kind of stuff than pretty much anyone else.

A) Latency is built in.  Unless you can increase the speed of light it's just going to take a while for signals to get to space an back.  Even in LEO you're adding 2 or 3 hundred miles to the trip vs a terrestrial connection.  Maybe you could *sort of* overcome that if the satellite had a massive data cache on board, but that would only solve some of the problem because there's plenty of activity you just can't cache.

The reason I ask is that I struggled with getting good internet at home for a while until I made sure to eliminate weak links in the chain. I didn’t realize I was using an outdated router and switch combination and my WiFi network was garbage - even though I was using modern mesh gear my apartment must be made of WiFi eating lead and copper lined walls.


I put in a prosumer style router in and gave up the wireless mesh for a more traditional but still not crazy expensive access point system with Ethernet backhaul (each of the two access points that blanket my place have Ethernet running to them directly). 

My setup costs a little bit more than one of these really expensive fancy “gaming routers” and I am amazed at how much better everything is. Whatever could be wired got wired too. No more dead zones. No more buffering. 


I have about 30 devices in my place (wireless cameras, tablets, phones, Apple TVs, several PCs, 4 Raspberry Pis, chromecasts, Amazon Echos and Google Home devices galore plus stuff I’m surely forgetting. I pay for and get the cheapest 100mbps service I can get.

The Hyperloop concept is a modern version of this same old idea, but it still hasn’t overcome the fundamental issues. One of those issues is maintaining low pressure for a very long series of tubes. The other major issue is the same one that causes most of the cost difficulties for high speed rail - if you’re moving at a high speed, then any bend must be very gradual and very long, so that it doesn’t feel like a roller coaster. That means that if there’s any terrain at all, you need lots of bridges and tunnels.

So what will it cost NASA to fly a fancy crewed capsule from SpaceX? Current estimates are between \~350 and \~450 million dollars a flight. So they could have done 3 launches for the same price as the space shuttle.

No this isn't how this works. You used the amount of capital raised through share issues and loans in your initial comment to try and imply that this was an indication of how successful the venture could be. ''It couldn't possibly be a PR stunt if he has raised money''. Saying you're going to launch 12,000 before a single functional satellite has been launched is from the Musk textbook of making ridiculous and unrealistic claims.


I pointed out that Musk owned companies have a precedent for using these methods of raising large amounts of capital while under delivering or failing miserably. E.g. SolarCity and Tesla.

>What number are they supposed to say? 

Perhaps some sort of realistic target. In fact, the goal for this first phase is actually only 400. An order of magnitude (relatively speaking) away from the nearly 12,000 he is pushing publicly.

>when it reality they've kept it pretty much completely under wraps until recently.

Bollocks. This World Wide Wi-Fi satellite scheme has been doing the rounds for at least a couple of years. It absolutely hasn't been kept under wraps. If you think companies don't hire PR firms to surreptitiously push stories then you are naive in the extreme. Not every bit of news, publicity etc has to come directly from a company via a press release.

>I'm aware that Musk gives unrealistic timelines (hence the ""elon time"" meme), **but he seems to be better at delivering on this kind of stuff than pretty much anyone else.**

This vague, unsourced, unprovable nonsense is why nobody takes sycophants like yourself seriously. By what metric are you measuring his superior delivery times? Who are you comparing him against? 

Those 'unrealistic' times can't just be written off as a quirk or 'it's just what Elon does'. If he is raising capital of the back of his disingenous claims then it is shady in the extreme. In fact, one could say his dramatic announcements with unrealistic time spans are in fact a PR stunt to raise as much capital of the back of some very optimistic goals... 

>Yes, believe it or not, developing space vehicles is difficult.

Yeah. So why the fuck does he think announcing he will be sending someone to Moon orbit by 2023 is realistic. Or sending a rocket to Mars by 2022; or a manned mission to Mars by 2024 is a sensible thing to publicly announce. Don't think I didn't notice you avoiding what I said here:

>What was it again? He wanted to launch a rocket to Mars by 2018? Whatever happened to that? Then he pushed it back to 2022, and said he would send a human crew by 2024? Whatever happened to that? Then he announced that he would send a tourist to Moon orbit by 2023 without ever even having sent a human into space, let alone have them stay for any great length of time. Oh what do you know, the tourist he announced has just revealed that he is broke. That definitely wasn't a PR stunt...

I notice you didn't even make a cursory mention of all these sourced, obvious PR stunts which you are now claiming Musk doesn't take part in.

>Jesus christ, 3 of your 4 most used words on reddit are ""fucking"", ""fuck"", and ""musk"". Talk about toxicity.

I swear a lot. Does that hurt you feelings? Not sure what that has to do with anything though. Doesn't detract form any of my arguments.

My feed is constantly clogged with quite obvious astro-turfed and bot upvoted pro-Musk shite on a daily basis. If I see shit I call it out, hence why I mention it so much. Coupled with the cult like worship of him on here (Example 1, you) it means I mention him more than I would like. I couldn't give a fuck how toxic it comes across. What matters is that I'm right. And so far all you have done is attempt to obfuscate. 

Did you run my profile through a user analyser or something? What a creepy cunt you are. Comes across as kind of desperate to be honest. 

Two can play that game. A cursory glance through your own profile shows you up for what you are. A sycophant.

Elon Musk's companies have plenty to gain from PR. Because that is literally all they have going for them.

SolarCity was bought out by Tesla.

Unless those 100 customers are willing to pony up $2,000 per year *each* you just burned a fuckton of money. $1,000 if that space laser backbone actually works sometime and you can sell 20gbps down, but how many customers can that support?

If Starlink gets rolling as fast as they plan, I think terrestrial rural broadband is going the way of the dodo bird. Many of those communities aren't served with decent broadband today because it's just not economically viable to do so. That isn't going to suddenly improve. Those rural providers don't have enough time or enough funding to upgrade their networks to properly compete. 

Having a competitor flying overhead that is faster and likely cheaper than anything a rural provider can currently offer is going to carve off a huge chunk of their subscriber base. What happens next is textbook economics in action.

This is a good thing though. I run a business that is totally location independent. I live in a big city because having high speed internet is non-negotiable. I need that for my life and my business.

4052,sazrocks,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/musk-on-starlink-internet-satellites-spacex-has-sufficient-capital.html,"Currently the vast vast majority of data flows through land based wired (fiber optic, coax (cable), DSL, etc.) and wireless (cell networks) networking equipment. Only a very small amount of data is sent through satellites (Iridium, HughesNet, etc.), usually where there is no alternative, because the connection just *sucks* (ridiculous prices with tiny data caps and super slow speeds). The situation gets a bit better for corporate buyers, but the pricing is still insane. Starlink hopes to solve this by having enough bandwidth that the service will be cheap, fast, and with large or no data caps.

One more tidbit: We actually run undersea cables to connect the continents together in the internet. These cables use fiber optics and can have terabits of capacity.

Super simplified, they work by accelerating ions of a noble gas out one end of the satellite(or whatever is doing the station keeping). 

The thrust they impart is really small but since they're in space and can keep firing for a really long time, they're great for satellite station keeping. The thrust they impart is so small that they don't work on the ground, but they're great in space. Probably a lot more than you wanted, but I think it's super cool.

4106,Fizrock,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/musk-on-starlink-internet-satellites-spacex-has-sufficient-capital.html,"> Saying you're going to launch 12,000 before a single functional satellite has been launched is the textbook definition of a PR stunt.  
  
As I mentioned above, and as you ignored, I don't think SpaceX or Musk has ever made a public statement saying they were going to launch that many. The only number I can find on Musk's twitter is the few hundred number to get it up and running like you mentioned. The 11,943 number comes from the FCC filing, which was not publicized. I find it hilarious that you ignored this point, as it completely dissolves your entire argument.   
  
> Perhaps some sort of realistic target. In fact, the goal for this first phase is actually only 400. An order of magnitude (relatively speaking) away from the nearly 12,000 he is pushing publicly.  
  
As I said, he has never mentioned the 12,000 number, to my knowledge. The only tweet where he mentions a specific number of launches is [this tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1128840713783791619), where he mentions a smaller amount, exactly like you claimed he should be pushing. 
   
The only people who seem to be aggrandizing this situation is the people writing the articles about it.  
  
> Bollocks. This World Wide Wi-Fi satellite scheme has been doing the rounds for at least a couple of years. It absolutely hasn't been kept under wraps. If you think companies don't hire PR firms to surreptitiously push stories then you are naive in the extreme. Not every bit of news, publicity etc has to come directly from a company via a press release.  
  
Really? So why did they essentially make zero public statement about it until last year? It's been making the rounds forever based on rumors and a patent they filed for ""Starlink"". Their rocket factory in Washington has been around for at least 3 years, and it's managed to stay almost completely under the radar.    
  
> Yeah. So why the fuck does he think announcing he will be sending someone to Moon orbit by 2023 is realistic. Or sending a rocket to Mars by 2022; or a manned mission to Mars by 2024 is a sensible thing to publicly announce. Don't think I didn't notice you avoiding what I said here:  
  
I don't think he does. As I already said, I'm aware he likes to give unrealistic timelines, but I don't particularly care.  
    
> This vague, unsourced, unprovable nonsense is why nobody takes sycophants like yourself seriously. By what metric are you measuring his superior delivery times? Who are you comparing him against?  
  
I don't know if you've noticed, but he's the CEO of two rather enormous, massively successful companies that exist in industries where success is extremely rare. The odds of both Tesla and SpaceX making it to this point were extraordinarily low, and it seems like it can't be a coincidence that both made it to this point with him behind the wheel. His many personal flaws aside, that's a sign of something.  
  
> I swear a lot. Does that hurt you feelings? Not sure what that has to do with anything though. Doesn't detract form any of my arguments.   
  
No, I'm just pointing it out. It's incredibly ironic about how you people complain how terrible Musk and his fans are, but are some of the most toxic people on the internet. You are the problem, not ""us"".   
  
> My feed is constantly clogged with quite obvious astro-turfed and bot upvoted pro-Musk shite on a daily basis. If I see shit I call it out, hence why I mention it so much. Coupled with the cult like worship of him on here (Example 1, you) it means I mention him more than I would like. I couldn't give a fuck how toxic it comes across. What matters is that I'm right. And so far all you have done is attempt to obfuscate.

One of the top dog orphans, 17, started pushing around 4. 5 tried to step in and protect her twin sister, but he was too strong and threw her out of the way. 17 began to tear off 4's pants as she cried and flayed, and then began to unbutton his own pants. A huge member came out of his trousers, in the shape of a 7, and stuck it inside 4's 0. 5 flailed her arms on 17's back crying for him to stop, but he threw his arm towards 5, causing a deep red gash on her forehead, she was knocked out. 17 began to take his hands and cover them over 4's mouth and nose, leaving her unable to breathe, and then faded to a darkness. 17 was given a life sentence in a high facility prison for the murder of 2 girls.﻿",news,t2_12jlaq,bpakkx,ens92hh,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/ens92hh/,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/

This cycle repeated itself for a little over 2 months, I maybe had interent for 20 days out of 70.  I told them I wasn't paying the last bill because their service was inadequate so they ended up reporting me to a collection agency which also happens to be owned by att.  

Through out the whole ordeal I dealt with their customer service which are at best inept and at worst down right fraudulant.  They kept my service on even though it wasn't hooked up for a couple months when they initially were trying to collect from me.  During that time they signed me up for all kinds of shit like premium network packages and advanced long distance calling. 

 They ended up selling my debt to another collection agency outside of the att umbrella and when I explained my ordeal they wiped my debt away and actually did what they could to not hurt my credit.  It was super painless and I appreciated that but fuck att.",news,t2_12jlaq,bpakkx,enssa6d,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/enssa6d/,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/

If you compare how fast SpaceX developed any of their technology to how long it takes any other aerospace company or government agency, it's crazy. 

SpaceX is 17 years old and in that time they have developed from scratch 3 rockets, working on a massive 4th, 4 rocket engines, 2 capsules, their own heat shield technology, all of the tech needed for landing rockets, their own satellites. They are also the first company to land an orbital rocket and land a rocket on a barge, the first private company to launch a craft to the ISS, to recover a space craft from orbit, to launch something into solar orbit. 

Meanwhile most of their competitors are still flying variants of rockets developed half a century ago. Arianespace & ULA are both  developing new rockets, not expected to be ready until 2020 & 2021 respectively, but they won't even be recoverable. SLS officially began in 2010 but large parts of it came from the shuttle and constellation programs before that and it will still take over a decade to fly, if it ever does.

That might happen for beta testers that connect via the 60 satellites being sent up tomorrow, but for the average Starlink user, the idea is that to minimise latency, your packets of data would beam up to a Starlink satellite via microwave, then get relayed along multiple Starlink satellites via laser until a Starlink satellite connected to a ground station on the US East Coast transmits that back down via microwave.

The re-transmission latency between satellites is meant to be very low, so combined with the (potentially) more direct route (vs a cable that perhaps goes up through Europe first or whatever), as well as the speed of light being 45% faster through the vacuum of space (and atmosphere) vs fibre optic cable you can make up for some additional latency on silicon and potentially higher packet losses.",news,t2_12jlaq,bpakkx,enrideh,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/enrideh/,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/

I personally live in New Zealand and am used to dealing with 130-200ms pings depending on west/east coast servers.

Adding 26ms to a game ping is usually not make or break, either. It's a minor disadvantage for most people.

In short - The guy brings up some valid points, although I'm not sure how many of those points are accurate to what actual realistic implementation might look like. 

Examples: 

- ""Stuff"" being in the way underground. Not sure how much of an issue this is. I don't think anyone ever thought the tunnels would be shallow, but it's a concern, sure. 

- Property rights extending infinitely below ground. Not sure what the laws are like regarding this but I didn't think property owners owned what was beneath the land they are on since you need special ""mineral rights"" in most places to be considered an ""owner"" of oil or whatever under your land. But sure, this could be legally icky. 

- Accident issues. He's claiming that cars moving at 150 mph in close proximity to hit the ""advertised"" car density rates per hour would need aircraft carrier levels of braking (which obviously is impossible) to prevent extreme pile ups and death tolls in case a wheel bursts or whatever. Fair point but this is obviously something that would be very high up on the ""figure out"" list before drilling even begins. 

- Bottlenecks. With very high car density and speed comes a problem of getting vehicle on and off the loop. Any delays causes ... well... delays, which erodes the benefits of the loop in the first place. 

- Effectiveness being reduced to existing infrastructure levels due to bottlenecks, throughput issues, density issues, etc... Which is a fair point with this design (I think, I'm not expert). 

It goes on and on. I'd say it's actually worth the watch.

This is what I said. Referring to Musk putting close to 12,000 satellites in orbit.

>He absolutely will. The rocket and **accompanying sattelites for this start of this project**...

This is what you said. The bold part here is what is relevant. You tried to imply that this was the beginning of the project, and linked an article to back it up. That very same article contradicts not only what you said, but what Musk said. The satellites being launched won't be able to function as part of a global Wi-fi network.

Well maybe before writing off any criticism of Musk as an 'anti-Musk' circlejerk you should do some research on the man himself, on his personal conduct, on his companies and on the practices of his companies. There is plenty of material out there. 

>I hesitate to trust the accuracy of your assessments of Musk's other business ventures.

You don't have to take my word. The material is out there. Compare what Hyperloop promised compared to what was delivered. Look at SolarCity being bought out with Tesla stock, there are now investors suing. Look at working practices at Musk owned companies and the concurrent anti-union drives. Look at Musk moving into any industry which can claim federal subsidies. Look at these kinds of PR puff pieces finding their way into the media whenever the slightest bit of bad news is reported. It is so blatantly transparent. All that was of the top of my head. There is so much suspicious activity surrounding Musk that I would be here all night.

War is no longer as costly with drones. Yes, the drones do have a nominal value, but it is relatively small compared to human cost and the experiences that those humans share when they come home (and when they don't.) The burden of a war waged by drones is very light. All of the functions of war that effectively serve to moderate the likelihood of war are stripped away when one side relies largely or even solely on drones. And the other side may still be paying those human and misc. costs.

Scuffed explanation because it's been a year since I took the class, but my biggest takeaway was that they make conflict more likely by manipulating/removing the cost of war (predicting the onset of war is conventionally viewed as a comparison between the cost of war and the benefit of war for each party). But yeah, what you wrote and what the other responses wrote about is all valid; the following is the vanilla explanation that I heard outside of pol classes: it's a lot easier to click a button and watch your drone fly away than it is to pull the trigger on a man within a city block or two.

In Yemen, it is unclear to what extent the Americans, as opposed to the Saudi-Emirati coalition, are responsible. In Afghanistan, the number of American strikes that killed or injured civilians more than doubled in the first nine months of 2018 compared with the corresponding period in the previous year and killed more than 150 civilians, according to the United Nations

4569,candre23,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/musk-on-starlink-internet-satellites-spacex-has-sufficient-capital.html,"Yes, you're missing a couple things.  They're not huge, but they're not insignificant either.

The first is that 5G has higher bandwidth capability and lower latency than wifi.  As you said, it's still bottlenecked by the connection to the microcell, but wifi is actually pretty bad at dealing with lots of simultanious connections, and 5G is better.  If you have 20 people sharing a 100mbps connection over wifi, they're not getting 5mbps each.  They're getting a lot less, because the wifi station is wasting a ton of potential bandwidth dealing with collisions.  5G handles all that better.

The next thing is that 5G connects automatically, and performs station handoffs quickly and transparently.  If you live anywhere even moderatly developed, you're probably within range of a wifi hotspot at almost all times, yet you are very rarely connected to one.  Wifi connections must be manually initiated, and if they're password protected, you must supply credentials.  If you move out of range of one hotspot into another, there is a pretty long delay while your device waits to ""give up"" on the old connection and starts looking for a new one.  Like all previous cellular generations, 5G hands you off between connections so well and so quickly that you don't even know the handoff occurred.

And lastly, as you guessed, there's mesh networking.  When it works, mesh nets are pretty great.  You no longer need to be within range of a cell to have connectivity - as long as you are withing range of somebody else who is within range of somebody else who is within range of a microcell, the packets will get there.",news,t2_12jlaq,bpakkx,ensp25a,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/ensp25a/,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/

I am talking real world speeds.  Even if the sky to ground link was 20ms and under you need 2 hops up and down so we are at the absolute best case just under 40ms.  Then lets factor in the down link site is not on top of amazon S3 East coast and has to cross 2 real world carrier rings to make it happen.  So there is another 10 to 15 ms.  So lets keep adding we are at 55ms on the way to my S3 bucket host from some where in North America.  Then we have to get back to me so 110 but i am in hopes they can get it under 100 with some optimization.  People act like this is some sort of insane 1000 ms thing. 100 ms is beyond solid heck that is on par with 3g speeds of old.  So lets keep all this in perspective.   The absolute fastest connection is fiber to a 1 ring cross to my server. That is sub 10ms.   


I have yet to see in my career something under 25 ms.   I even buy private line custom Metro Ethernet fiber switched networks from major telecoms at a huge market and i can not muster beyond that.  So i am being realistic in my hopes for them.   If comcast on fiber can not get me under 30ms to amazon how can we expect Elon to best that by 3 ms flying in the sky with exposed diffused lasers or microwave.  Comcast has killer gear on killer fiber they are not messing around.  So lets keep all that in mind. 


I am extremely pumped for star link do not get me wrong.  I would take a 100 meg high bandwidth connection with a 100 ms ping any day of the week.   ATT where i am right now on 4g is about 45 ms and i can see the tower from my window.

Also have to take in to consideration optical turbulence -- the refractive index structure parameter can shift dramatically, depending on weather, gravity waves, etc. Diffusion is also going to be a problem.

Why does everyone ignore the fact that the Tarlys were traitors? They were sworn to House Tyrell but chose to side with the Lannisters and then proceeded to help sack the seat of the Reach (the Tyrell hold). The fact that Danerys even gave them a chance to survive (with lands and titles at that!) is more mercy than even any modern, let alone a medieval, government would have given traitors. And then they refused it. And burning is cruel, but you should look up some historical punishments for traitors, especially those who attempted or committed regicide. Dany, roasting people with a dragon, looks like a saint in comparison.

Earlier seasons have better character development for Dany's descent into tyranny, but they full on stopped that development from mid-S6 to mid-S8. That's the real problem with it. It's just people (Sansa and Varys) saying ""I don't know about her..."" and that's the basis for it until they kick it back off halfway through S8EP04. And then it just steamrolls right into her going nuts at the sounds of bells. They probably put less than 10 minutes of screen time to developing this over the past 2 seasons. And, I would argue, Dany going evil is the most important point to develop and set up over the past 2 seasons. But they ignored it so it would be more ""shocking"" for viewers because that's all that matters. But it just feels hollow under even the slightest analysis.",news,t2_12jlaq,bpakkx,enrnjng,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/enrnjng/,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/

In fact, if it's going to a ground station closer to the destination the transmission between satellites will be faster than transmission through fiber on the ground. The links between satellites and presumably between satellites and the ground hubs are going to be full duplex point to point links. This means there is no need for congestion avoidance or TDM or any of the myriad of latency inducing problems that you get with point to multipoint links where only one client can talk at a time and they have to negotiate to make sure that they aren't talking over another endpoint.

Going between satellites is going to be much closer to a straight path than going over fiber on the ground. The propagation speed in a vacuum and in air is approximately 50% faster that the propagation speed in fiber. The satellites themselves are probably going to be handling routing via something akin to MPLS and calculate all of the routing tables on the ground for each satellite and upload it to them so they should be able to route at line rate and match the routing latency of typical backbone routers.

In the other movies it seems to imply that the machines don't really have much of a penchant for backstabbing. When the oracle asks the architect weather he will honor the agreement he says something like ""what do you take me for, a human?"" In the animatrix it shows the machines constantly trying to work out a diplomatic solution, sticking to the rules, and only going to war when the humans try to wipe them out. Then even after they defeat the humans they lay out the conditions for moving forward in a treaty. Smith tries to get neo to agree to a deal early in the first movie, and the trillogy comes to an end with the machines and humans reaching an agreement. 

Also, it's implied that when neo destroyed smith in the first movie that some aspect of humanness was overwritten on smith which is why he didn't do what he was supposed to do, which is probably return to the source. That aspect of humanness was probably the ability to see beyond some purely mechanical ""if a then be therefore c"" kind of machine thinking. Essentially free will. They have other rouge programs that are characterized a just ""not doing what they're supposed to"" which the machines then went about trying to hunt down and destroy. Which you could interpret as the main system trying to govern it's own cognitive evolution and to stamp out any forms of evolution that would create instability like free will or illogical functions closer to love. 

Which gets back to your original comment about how much better it would have been if they had been allowed to say that the machines were using the human brain for it's processing power. That would have been a perfect storyline for how as the symbiotic relationship between machines and humans continued, the two began to merge. Using human brains as a primary source of processing power was subtly changing general machine consciousness and culture to be more ""human like"". The higher level aspects of the machine society/consciousness (however all that works) are trying to subdue it as much as possible but can't. I really think that's what the Wachowski's were going for. It explains a lot of the sloppiness of the other two movies, and how it seems to unravel the further they go. Like that father and son who are refugees that neo meets when he's trapped in the train station. It feels like a plot line out of nowhere that leads nowhere, and sort of forced in. I think that in the original story it was supposed to be a revelation moment where we see that all of these rouge programs (smith, the oracle, the merovingian, the refugee) are involved in this struggle that mirrors the human struggle and that is really the same struggle. Not humans vs. machines, but free will vs. authoritarianism.

Since latency measurements are round trip, that means you have to go from you to the satellite, then between satellites until you reach a satellite that has a link to a ground station, then from ground station to your destination, and then all the way back.

Since the average case would be a quarter orbit around the earth to your destination, that means you have to go ~21500km to get there.

I’m sitting in front of a terminal that is connected to a server that has a very fat dedicated connection to another server ~100km away. It takes 1.2ms to do round trip, which is 1.8 times what you get from pure speed of light communication. Assuming Musk manages to get that down to, say, 1.5 times, you’re still looking at **110ms** to make the average round trip.

So let’s assume Musk meant “best case is 25ms latency”, and assume that means you go from you to nearest satellite, nearest satellite to next door neighbor satellite, next door neighbor satellite to another satellite, that satellite to conveniently-located ground station, conveniently-located ground station to destination and back. Let’s also assume your destination is within, say, 1000km of the ground station - massively unlikely, but whatever, right? That gives 560+225+225+560+1000+1000+560+225+225+560=5120km, and we’ll use our previous metric of 66% of light speed. That’s 25.6ms, which is just over Musk’s figure, but it would require a two-hop trip to a satellite above a ground station and a destination that all fall within a circle of radius approximately equal to 1600km. How many people do you know that will live within that distance from both their network destination *and* a satellite ground station? Maybe if you live in San Francisco or next door to SpaceX, but otherwise good fucking luck.",news,t2_12jlaq,bpakkx,enukebn,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/enukebn/,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/

> *Moreover, “even assuming a highly unlikely and apocryphal case in which all 1,584 satellites proposed for deployment at 550 kilometers were immediately incapable of maneuvering upon orbital injection, remained in a stowed configuration, and were deorbiting during a period of solar minimum, the aggregate probability of collision would be 1,584 x 0.000000303 = 0.00048 – which is still less than half the 0.001 probability standard established by NASA [for a single satellite].”*    
  
So even in the absolute worse case scenario, the entire initial constellation combined is still within NASA safety standards for a single satellite.   
  
If you want the math for the 11,943 satellites, 11,943*0.000000303 = 0.003618729, which would actually put it within the safety standard for 4 satellites. So I was wrong, it's actually even safer than that.  
  
The one issue with my math at the end there is that the 12k satellites will be distributed above and below 550km as well, so the actual number is probably a bit off from 0.0036.  
  
My statement that they're the safest satellites ever launched might be inaccurate, but it's at the very least pretty darn close.",news,t2_12jlaq,bpakkx,enxohtu,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/enxohtu/,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/

Is it called orbital pollution or you came up with that?  

Again, functioning satellites is by definition not ""useless junk"".  

May I ask why do you even care about things orbiting above you?  

>The only person derailing this conversation is you...  

How exactly?

>I DONT CARE ABOUT SATELITE FACTS!!!

Calm down. So it's your decision to stay ignorant? I just explained why you are wrong and provided links to help you understand, but you do you.  

>I care about the pollution it’s going to cause!!! These satellites DO NOT come back down to earth, they remain defunct in orbit. As shown in the popsci article.  

They do come down, I really encourage you to check the table I linked that tells how much time it takes for specific orbital altitudes to decay.  

Can you please quote the paragraph where the popsci article explains why orbital decay doesn't exist?  
Because your article says exactly nothing about that. It's about a github project.  

>Don’t even get me started on the amount of emission caused by the endless volley of rockets carrying these into space. 

>200 rockets every 5-7 years is literally an astronomical amount of pollution.  

Oh, that's even more stupid than your previous argument.  

>The average emissions per US citizen per year is 17.6 tonnes. That means just 56 Americans in a year will produce more CO2 than a Falcon Heavy launch. For a sense of scale, the USA's population grows by 56 every 13 minutes.

>You could actually launch 5.5 million Falcon Heavys in a year, and you still wouldn't match the US's annual CO2 output. Using a Dragon V2 on each one, you could launch the entire population of California to Mars, and still have room for the Alaskans.  

(Note: Falcon Heavy is about 3 times bigger than the rocket used to launch these satellites)

Rocket launches make pretty much irrelevant pollution, not astronomical whatever that you claim without any maths to back it up.  
Planes, cars, ships, heating, electricity generation, farms and heavy industry are that should interest you if you care for the environment.

Her whole character was set up to have this fall from grace and all the signs are there and have been from the beginning. She and Viserys are told that the people of Westeros eagerly await their liberation from the Usurper her entire childhood. Reality did not mirror this as it turns out the commoners only care so much as they have food and entertainment and don't care who sits the throne as long as that happens. Her character is disappointed that she isn't welcomed with open arms and begins to resent the common folk. But they do little to really show this. There was maybe 2-3 lines of dialogue about this the entire season. They very poorly set up *why* she would go after the commoners after she won. This upcoming episode hopefully explains it but I fear the pacing issues that have plagued the last two seasons will just have her character motivations glossed over as they move right into the next bullet point on their plot outline.

Back to the Tarlys: my problem, and apparently the issue others had, is that her treatment of the Tarlys isn't especially egregious but it's the most egregious thing she did all of S7. And that is where they messed up. They should have had her progressively going 'Fire and Blood' on different parts of Westeros in the build up to Kings Landing. All these problems are a case of them telling us and not showing us because they rushed S7 and S8. We got 13 episodes instead of 20. A lot of problems would have been solved by them fleshing out their story decisions and pacing it similar to previous seasons, instead of a lot of undefined time jumps that result in inconsistencies.

The question is how far along the tubes do you need to go?   The gigabit hookup we got at work shows a pure saturated gigabit connection on speedtest.net.....when going to the same companies servers near by.

Switching from Century Link (our work provider) servers to say Comcast, even though it's the same area, showed a 30% drop.  Then once you leave the city and start going to other servers, say one state over, you'll notice it even more.  Ping is less affected by distance over gigabit though.

 Here at my house I have normal cable and get 150mbps down to the local server.  Connecting to a server across the world in Australia I get comparable download speeds to the local server, but the ping obviously goes to shit.

TL;DR. Gigabit seems to drop off more the farther away you do a speediest compared to local cable internet.",news,t2_12jlaq,bpakkx,entz0yq,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/entz0yq/,/r/news/comments/bpakkx/elon_musk_will_launch_11943_satellites_in_low/
