The urban areas will get more ground stations to reduce hops and increase bandwidth.  as a by product latency will be lower than average due to less distance no?  
also i disagree that 1000km to the datacenter from ground station is unlikely.  the major of people live in urban areas.  this will leave to datacenters being more local.  Then you also can't discount putting CDN's into the peering locations for starlink uplink stations resulting in even less latency.   

this all goes out of the window for the guy trying to game without lag in montana.   it appears to be a fairly dynamic system that will be better where there is more user density possibilities.

You say ""Boeing and MCD did tests and launches of them in the 70s, and deemed the cost savings not worth the investment. I still feel like it's not"" 

It's nice that you feel something, but the data doesn't support your feelings, and neither does the market.  Also having an idea doesn't mean anything in this world.  Execution is everything.  FB wasn't the first social media account. Uber wasn't the first ridesharing. AirBNB wasn't the first home rental company.  Even if SpaceX didn't come up with the idea of reusable rockets, they were the ones that did it. 

As far as ""not worth the investment"". 

Considering before SpaceX [Arianespace had dominated the commercial launch market for many years. ""In 2004, for example, they held over 50% of the world market.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_launch_market_competition#Before_2014) but now ""SpaceX's market share increased rapidly. In 2016, SpaceX had 30% global market share for newly awarded commercial launch contracts, in 2017 the market share reached 45%, the estimate for 2018 is about 65% as of July 2018.""

Furthermore, ""Despite ULA restructuring begun in 2014 to decrease launch costs by half,[26] the cheapest ULA space launch in early 2018 remained the Atlas V 401 at a price of approximately US$109 million, more than US$40 million more than a SpaceX standard commercial launch, ""

Why are you being so pedantic about this? Obviously they are fully functioning. That doesn’t make them useful or not junk. 

The only useful unmanned satellites are ones gathering data about space itself, all others I consider useless junk. With the exception of GPS and weather. Sure it’s my opinion.

Because I care about the overall well-being of the space rock that I live and breath on. Useless junk threatens that wellbeing.

Yes, things fall, continuously and indefinitely. It’s still above us in earths orbit. I don’t need a twitter comment to tell me how orbit works.

The goal is to find the balance that as a society brings us the most benefit. I agree that conflating either side with good or bad is not useful, which is what you are criticizing him for doing with corporations, but doing yourself with ""the government"".

>Yes, things fall, continuously and indefinitely. It’s still above us in earths orbit. I don’t need a twitter comment to tell me how orbit works.  

You literally deny that orbital decay is a real thing and that Starlink satellites (and everything else) fall into the atmosphere from 400km orbits within a year u less they are boosted? Because that is a textbook example of willfull ignorance.  

>The last person on earth I would take advice from is some who posts data from twitter and video games.  

Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know about these special needs. Is the NY Times featuring the same chart enough? What exactly do you require to that you would consider learning from?

>You do realize this is **in addition to** the current rates of human pollution. You also fail to recognize the amount of pollution that’s going to be generated manufacturing all these satelits and rockets. Again, the shortsightedness is astounding. 

But it's practically nothing. You can talk about the 30%, or the 20%. Argue about the 15% or the 10%. Act against 8% or 7% of the pollution. Care about the 5% or 4%. Yet you convince yourself that the 0.0001% is much more important that all the people that could finally access internet living anywhere.  
Maybe look up Pareto, he might teach you some life lessons.  

So you want humanity to do nothing? To go back to the middle ages?  

It's even funny considering Musk's electric cars saved multiple times more CO2 emissions than any rockets he may have launched.

He's socially and emotionally crippled and constantly has to be the center of attention. With Zuckerberg it's easy to just write him off as evil, and pre-marriage Bill Gates was much of the same thing until he met his better half. But Elon walks the line between being sometimes good and sometimes awful and I wish he could just commit to being good.

This statement in particular is troubling; Elon is lashing out because he couldn't be the hero, he's attacking real heroes who risked life and limb to do the right thing, he's perpetrating a stereotype against any non-native person who's visited Southeast Asia for business or pleasure, and since we know Elon is so strange socially I wouldn't be surprised if he's just projecting his own fantasies on others.

I realize Elon is a visionary but the practical day-to-day implementation of his visions leave a lot to be desired. The submarine was a stupid idea from the get-go and I can't believe he's still salty over the idea that a traditional rescue was successful and nobody needed his impractical solution.

But if Musk’s tech team was able to dig up some dirt on the guy (e.g., records of financial transactions that link him to child porn purchases), which I assume is plausible or likely given the nature of the claim, how would this play out? Would the guy lose any legal recourse, and would Thai/British authorities use the evidence that Musk dug up to arrest the guy?

Consider for a second that at one point these kids were expected to stay in these caves for possibly up to a few months and that they did not see a way to get them out at one point. Elon being the computer minded person he is believes that his team of incredibly intelligent, talented and more than likely very sincere engineers have a good chance of being able to come up with something that could help rescue these kids.

They work hard and probably VERY long hours around the clock designing and building something that could help. While this is going on, other engineers on site are figuring out other ways to help rescue the kids. It's decided that it is far better to rescue them sooner rather than later and opt to go with full face masks and wrapping them in multiple wetsuits and strapping them to a litter.

All the boys are saved, same with the coach and everyone is happy. Except, for some reason people are publicly calling out Elon for not helping, promoting himself (even though it was literally his team of engineers that made this, not just him), and trying to glory hog.

Think about that for a second and just assume that he genuinely just wanted to help but his concept was what, a week late, and they went with another rescue format first that worked. So instead people decided to attack him personally online and on the news, essentially saying he didn't care about these kids at all.

What would have happened if a child died on this rescue? What would the reaction be if it was his tube that was actually used and saved everyone?

His comments are absolutely reprehensible and PR ending with regards to this last one. But I do understand his frustration for being called someone who doesn't care when he very likely cared a LOT and also had the ability and resources to do something about it. Just because his actions didn't result in the saving of the kids, at least he tried. Which is more than can be said for 99.9&#37; of the people calling him out.

Edit: In regards to the initial video showing off their work, this is Tesla and SpaceX we're talking about.

Why are all these comments talking about the submarine idea?
What has how helpful Musk was got to do with him calling someone a pedophile?  Are there people out there who seriously think it's ok to accuse someone of the worst crime imaginable short of murder just because they annoy you? Has our immature internet culture really sunk that low that this does not cross any lines for you people?
I never understood how he could have thought a submarine would possibly work in a twisty jagged cave in any event, as for him being there, you have to understand that when you make a name/brand in politics or celeb status or business it grants you access to all kinds of places by default as people giggle (even grown adults) and stand in awe that you are willing to grant them, the little serfs, your time.  Really it's true you'd be amazed how grown adults behave differently around people just because they are famous.  They were also brainstorming ANY ideas so it made sense that they talked to everyone.  The sub idea was really silly, it might have worked for some other kind of rescue but not this.  If you think Musk did this because he's a good guy then consider:
1. How many other PR stunts he's done just for PR not to acctually accomplish anything (ie the man in the car in orbit)
2. Hes drowning in money but still takes subsidies from the US govt and dodges his taxes like any other billionare
3. His response to someone questioning his plan was to accuse them of the second worst crime in existance short of murder (devestating evidence of his character if ever there could be one)
....but worst of all
4. He is currently one of the biggest doners to a set up trying to keep GOP control over the US congress.  This is the congress backing a psudo-fascist president who is targeting the families of terrorists (not just the terrorists) with drone strikes, seperating kids from parents then losing the kids at the border, taking healthcare away from millions of people, cutting taxes for the top 1% of earners, creating laws criminalizing protest and defunding scientific research programs including the EPA and CDC.

Don't get me wrong, Elon responding with the 'pedo' comment is mind mindbogglingly wrong on every level. Just saying the diver was hugely insulting to begin with. 

The only way I can get my head around this is if Elon heard the diver's abuse, got blind drunk to drown his frustrations, then took to twitter. How could he have been so stupid?

By the way, I am an expat living in Bangkok so calling us all 'sus' doesn't go down to well with me either. Elon himself has ties to Bangkok. He is part of the 'Bangkok Expats' facebook group (according to a friend). None of this makes sense.

Remember all his statements about now SpaceX was going to the moon in a year and Mars in a few years and people on Reddit were so infatuated with Musk that they neglected the logistical problems with the plans and failed to recognize it's all just a PR stunt to gain investors? Well the moon story is a year old now and I don't think SpaceX is going to the moon.

SpaceX employees have done some amazing work. Elon Musk does not. He's just a PR man now with a cult like, hero worship following. Many people who had hope in Elon Musk but are also experts in the fields Musk pretends to be an expert in realized Musk lack of knowledge about anything he talks about after his hyperloop proposal. Go read any criticism of that project and you'll find so many engineering erros that undergrad students would fail for yet alone a major company like SpaceX.

I never thought of Musk as some down to earth, humble and kind person anyway. It's not like this article makes me hate him or something like that. The guy he called pedo (which is as derogatory as it gets) wasn't being that nice either.  He might mean a hero to all of us but there was no need of saying the line 'Elon can go and stick his device where it hurts' and he started it after all. Elon might be a billionaire and shit but he's no saint (might be an asshole to everyone for all I care)
Even if Elon was showing off to the whole world that he's coming to the rescue of these people, I'd still not go as far as criticising him about it. People show off their expensive cars and shit but I'd love it if most people in the world started showing off that they're helping others. Atleast they'll do some good out of it.

But in what ways did Musk's ""plan"" not work out?

He at least [claimed](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1015507453818044416) to have had some feedback for the design process, so I would really like to have an opinion from a different cave expert who also was at the site.

Also, was there any reason for Mr Unsworth to negotiate the fact that there were efforts made? Any contribution is a contribution and not everyone can pull out an effort as fast as Musk is able to, so why not apprechiate it?",news,t2_1jw9f6nn,8z2i6q,e2gbiug,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/e2gbiug/,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/

Even when he got world-famous by actually making the F9 work the way he promised it would, and Tesla was semi-functional.....still 99% of his public statements were tech-oriented.


Lately, however, he's broadened his horizons and had occasion to act like a ""generic celebrity"" on Twitter and on-camera.....but he doesn't have the standard celebrity PR sense (as he's never had to really watch what he says before, as few people get up in arms about a futurism-oriented comment) to edit himself before he hits the ""submit"" button.


He's also an awkward SOB when he gets in front of people who aren't his natural audience. This is compounded by the fact that his success with Paypal allowed him to build SpaceX as his own private empire, where there's never really been anyone to flip him the bird or otherwise fuck with him.....So someone with cameratime calling him out isn't something he's used to. 


Bottom Line: Unless Musk takes a step back into the Space/Tech domain (where he both knows the game and is given the respect he needs to not be an idiot on Twitter) and stays off of Current Events.....expect fairly frequent ""Musk Meltdowns"". He doesn't have skin thick enough to handle the rough and tumble of mainstream culture...and he doesn't look like he's interested in growing his skin any thicker.",news,t2_1jw9f6nn,8z2i6q,e2hqdzy,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/e2hqdzy/,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/

That is the issue with the Musk's involvement.  Deviation from workflow or expansion of scope can cause unacceptable delays in projects and adds to the stress.  People say and do foolish shit when stressed.  Cave diving to rescue a bunch of kids is probably the most stressful thing on earth.  

As for Musk, all managers, and volunteers need to learn that their direct involvement in a task, is actually secondary to the goal of the task.  He's probably picked up some bad management habits from his time working so heavily with SpaceX--and that's what we're seeing.

He makes this claustrophobic looking dildo that he tests in a crystal clear high school swimming pool, posts that on twitter that it's ready for Thailand, then he flies his environmentally friendly private billionaire jet to Thailand and takes a photograph of him messing around inside the cave and then says ""Thailand is such a beautiful place thanks guys!"" as if he's on fucking vacation and leaves that giant dildo behind and gets butt hurt when rescuers and officials say the thing wasn't practical or going to work. Then he's like, well I only talked to the British diver and he said he wanted my help so nanananannananananana! Then in another hilarious twist, the diver is like ""hey wtf are you are bringing me into this shit? I also thought the sub ended up impractical dude"" Then Musk, after getting called out on his BS goes into ""nervous breakdown"" mode and what I like to call the ultimate 5th grade mode that Trump has mastered to an art, and calls the diver ""Well I think you're a pedo.....""  For his idol worshippers who treat him like he's Kim Jong Il, where they bow down to his portrait shrine in their bedrooms every morning before high school, this recent outburst is really hard to defend and twist around into something innocent. I do have hope for humanity when I do find a handful of people that have the critical thinking ability to go ""Hey I liked Elon, and I even thought the cave thing was fine but this has gone too far.""

but so what ? he did ""something"" maybe he got some publicity from it, but I don't think this was just a publicity stunt. He wanted to help and did what his company is best at. Building amazing contraptions to solve problems.

You just assume it a known fact at this point when we can never truly know his true intentions. No one can besides himself. I choose to believe people in this world people do things for good (and we have really no reason or evidence to believe it was a pr stunt besides some peoples gut feeling) and that just might be me being an optimist. When you said “do you think this is a good thing and a testament to his character” I do believe hard work is a testament to someone character. 

And if I answered your hypothetical question that had nothing to do what we were talking about, about who works harder. You probably wouldn’t like my hypothetical answer

And what about the statement “he can shove it where it hurts” is a “fair assessment” and not an insult???? 

My whole thing was that Elon (calling someone by there name is not cultist behavior btw) was mad so in the moment I can see how he made the regrettable action of calling someone a pedo. The diver was most certainly not completely innocent either. But this was suppose to be about just the name calling but you were changing subject left and right. Theres a time and place to have a debate about employees and working conditions and here was most certainly not it. 

It’s more likely that Elon was seriously trying to help the kids out and got mad that someone shitted on him for it, then it being a PR stunt and having a mental breakdown. Occam's razor

2. [According to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/world/asia/thai-cave-rescue-soccer-team.html) some passageways in the cave system were enlarged by the divers, meaning the difficulties that the pedo was describing was not accurate.

3. He insults Elon Musk multiple times in the interview unprovoked.

Instead he makes a token effort and says he ""helped."" His reacting this way to someone he sees as stealing the spotlight is emblematic of this attitude.


The attitude of ""What have YOU done for Flint?"" is asinine to me, too. If i had Musk's money, that question would be relevant. But no, my philanthropy is limited by the fact that if I give too much i might not make rent. He has no such burden amd, honestly, no need of the incomprehensible amount of capital he is hoarding and trying to protect from the government.

If you are seem petty enough to respond to tweets, then you will probably read this too....Long story short, I had always believed you to be a good person,  and I always supported what TESLA was trying to do from the very beginning. I even had TESLA stock when it was $21 dollars a share in 2006, and I bought it because I believed in the person as well as the company. It felt good to know that someone was helping to innovate and change the world, but if any of what has been said about your attitude is true, then I can  no longer support what I had initially believed to be a compassionate person. I initially thought that it was benevolent and kind of you to offer help to the Thai rescuers, but if you feel it more appropriate to respond to other people's comments with labels and stereotypes, and if you only helped in the rescue to further your PR efforts, then I apologize for wasting my time in nurturing the belief that you were somehow a better person than the other CEO's out there who blatantly, and shamelessly, work only for the betterment of themselves and their share price.  Hopefully I am wrong in my assessment, and maybe I don't have all the facts. If this is the case, then I apologize. But if not, then it's a real shame that someone such as yourself would rather destroy a person's reputation, than take the high road and brush off any perceived wounds you feel that your pride may have suffered.  Whatever the case may be, spend the rest of the day thinking about how others perceive you and try and be better. Not as a CEO, not as an inventor, but as a person.

Stress is an odd thing where you have no idea it’s overwhelming you until something stupid (like calling someone a pedo) happens and you just can’t put you finger on why it happened at all. 

I think his stress isn’t coming from Tesla or SpaceX. If you look at any of his tweets, he’s always attacking the media and naysayers. Why? Because of the fake news problem and the attacks towards him, not because of anything related to his companies. These things are causing him the most stress, they cast doubt into his ability and layer his companies with unnecessary expectations and overwork him and everyone around him. 

If he simply turned social media off and stopped reading the news (at least the fake news), he could relieve the majority of his stress and excel at everything again. He should let someone else deal with all the media and let the haters just be. I think after this incident he will either figure this out or say one thing too much next time he gets overwhelmed.

Generally, libel has to be a false statement knowingly made while knowing that it's not true. If it's just your opinion or if you think or believe it to be true then it's usually not libel. Problem here is that the way he stated it is as good of evidence of libel as it is that it was just an opinion. Saying ""pedo guy""  instead of actually alleging that he in fact molests kids and ""bet a signed dollar it's true"" suggest that it's just his opinion or gamble. The lack or any actual support could also support an argument that no reasonable person  would consider them fact statements, only opinions or out of the blue insults. Of course you could also try to establish the opposite based on the same aspects.

In reality this would be jurisdiction specific, depend on the fact finder, and ultimately likely depend on a question of law to be resolved by the relevant higher courts. Twitter is a still mostly unresolved battlefield in libel law.

No good deed goes unpunished though.

A guy who claims he's a diver wasn't seen by Elon at the site, so naturally he thinks it's a ruse, hence asking for proof. You guys should understand that many people think and want Tesla to fail. It's the most shorted stock currently, which means people that have sold millions of dollars of Tesla stock as a short position need the stock price to fall, or else they lose money. You can argue that Tesla is a bad company, but it's profits are increasing now. So someone millions of dollars deep who is shorting Tesla has incentive to see the stock fall for non legitimate reasons, a smear campaign, that is a possible motive.

It looks like this diver is legit, I've yet to see definitive proof, but I'll assume it's true. This guy attacks Elon for doing a good deed, boiling it all down as a PR stunt. Maybe it's true or maybe Elon has a heart, I think he does. So it's extremely rude to assume the worst about Elon in this situation. No good deed goes unpunished.

Elon tried, Elon was too late, Elon was attacked for his efforts and called a PR whore and an animal. That hurts when you put yourself out there knowing people will criticize.

A diver was dead. Kids nearing death. Elon jumped into action halting his business duties to save lives. Of course that's good PR, but to say he had no other intentions if fallicious thinking. He came up with a plausible idea based off his current knowledge and correspondence with people there.

Elon is a hero in my eyes for this regardless of what the hive mind thinks. Regardless if you think this was purely for PR. I sense he has a good heart, is passionate, wants to defend his company, wants to create new ways to do things and solve problems, wants to save lives, wants to be a hero. He's doing it.

Shame on you Reddit for assuming the worst. Shame on you joining the bandwagon without considering the facts. People make mistakes, but he's still trying despite being flamed nonstop. How are you trying to improve the world? What impact have you created?

Has our immature internet culture really sunk that low that this does not cross any lines for you people?
I never understood how he could have thought a submarine would possibly work in a twisty jagged cave in any event, as for him being there, you have to understand that when you make a name/brand in politics or celeb status or business it grants you access to all kinds of places by default as people giggle (even grown adults) and stand in awe that you are willing to grant them, the little serfs, your time.  Really it's true you'd be amazed how grown adults behave differently around people just because they are famous.  They were also brainstorming ANY ideas so it made sense that they talked to everyone.  The sub idea was really silly, it might have worked for some other kind of rescue but not this.  If you think Musk did this because he's a good guy then consider:

He put colonizing Mars back into peoples heads.  He's solving transportation problems with boring tunnels and hyperloops.

Making the world more solar and energy independant with battery packs for homes and solar roof tiles.  Made one of the first digital currencies.

SpaceX is also linked with tesla and has some debt from it and solar city.**

--------------------------

This is why Tesla is the most shorted stock on the market and why some people want Musk out: 




Summary of Tesla's situation:

- Tesla currently has 2.67 billion in cash.

- About 1.1 billion of this is in loans that need to be returned early next year

- Around 40% of their cash in hand is from refundable deposits, many from people who thought they would get a $35k car

- Tesla cannot make $35k Model 3s at a profit right now or in the near future(this is generally accepted, and even Tesla hinted at it), they'll probably lose money even making $42k cars. They need to make $50k cars at scale to earn strong profits

- When asked in the earning call last for last quarter about reservations and how many people chose to cancel/take up their car once offered, Musk stunningly called the question ""boring"" and ""boneheaded"" and went on take questions from a youtuber for 20 mins. This was considered unprecedented and bizarre and stock dove.

- Tesla is losing about 800-900 million a quarter, so they will run out of money without a cash infusion. Literally everyone(all major banks/investors/analysts) knows that Tesla will need to raise capital this year.

- Musk though, has insisted that Tesla will not need to raise cash because they will be ""profitable by Q3 or Q4"". A reminder that they lost 780 million in Q1, and even small profits won't be enough to prevent running out of cash. In order to make sustainable profits they need to sell around 10,000 model 3s a week. They were supposed to produce 5000 cars a week in 2017. They have just now been able to produce 2500/week.

- Even bulls say that Musk is bluffing and he will eventually raise cash this year. Moody's downgrade of Tesla to essentially junk stocks makes it harder to raise cash at good interest rates. Moreover, there is speculation and some evidence that the reason Tesla haven't already done so, is that they are under SEC investigation which would prevent them from raising cash without disclosing a lot of details harmful to them.

- Tesla has access to standard credit lines for about 500 million, but they recently had to pledge their Fremont factory to just maintain these credit lines.

- A lot of Tesla's financial executives have left the company - a red flag to many including Jim Chanos, who famously shorted Enron due to similar indicators. The head of autopilot left and the head of engineering left 'for vacation' recently

- Tesla's autopilot is complete false advertising. Their original autopilot was developed by MobilEye. MobilEye hated tesla's exaggeration of the system's capabilities and withdrew their supply after a person died using autopilot. Tesla responded that mobileye was jealous of Tesla's superior ""Enhanced Autopilot"" which has hardware capable of full self driving. It is generally accepted on owner and enthusiast forums that enhanced autopilot is worse than mobileye's system right now(edit: in the last few months some people feel Enhanced AP has surpassed the original one in terms of capabilities, though most agree it is still less relaible), and in general both are basically lane-keeping system with AEB. Waymo and GM/Cruise are far ahead with their FSD capabilities than Tesla(again, widely accepted)

- Part of Tesla's debt comes from bailing out Solar City, a completely unprofitable company loaded with debt that was run by Musk's cousins. Some people saw this as nepotistic and a conflict of interest(Musk held part ownership of SolarCity while his cousins ran it), with a few investors suing Tesla over the deal.

- Starting from 2019 and 2020, all the major automakers are bringing out electric models. This will further damage Tesla's competitiveness, since they have the wost QA and build quality due to their haphazard and panicked development process and their $7500 tax credit is about to run out. 

Despite all this, the market cap of tesla is larger than Ford, Fiat and nearly equal to GM. Their inflated market cap(which even Musk admits is inflated if you ""look at past results"") is fuelling their funding which inflates the market cap even more as they lose more money trying to make bigger promises. 

What does Tesla have to its advantage? Tremendous marketing and brand value. They're probably inching towards or even surpassing Apple - and virtually all of this is tied to Musk. 

What does Tesla have against it? The realities of running a business and actually making the products.


**Edit**: I did not expect this to blow up and regret not linking the sources(the original text was for myself and people who follow tesla closely). Most of it is from quarterly earnings report, public statements, article and analysis. It's very late night here, I will update this comment with sources for every point tomorrow. In the mean time you can google most of the specific ones. (Eg: 'Tesla Fremont factory pledge' leads to this: https://www.reuters.com/article/tesla-factory/tesla-offers-fremont-factory-to-boost-liquidity-ifr-news-idUSL1N1SF2LU) or ask at r/RealTesla 

**Also**: I don't short Tesla and I am not an investor or stock expert: just someone who's spent the past few months researching them out of curiosity that stemmed form my interest in them. I think people should be exposed to the reasons why Tesla is betted against, as people don't hear the reasons in the mainstream - just the fact that they are 'in trouble' or 'shorted'. But most people would like to know more, so I posted this. 

------------------------

Edit 2: I'm back, here are some quick responses to **common questions**: 

1)'Some German engineers recently said Model 3 cost 28k to make after Production and Materials were accounted for'. 


This only takes into account production costs but Tesla have way more costs with them due to being new to the industry and creating their manufacturing process. 

>Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business says the margins on the Model 3 must still pay for a cost structure that legacy carmakers don’t have, including planned factory expansions, new automation investments, and its own dealership network. While Tesla has its own advantages, like integrated solar and energy storage products and no costly pension liabilities, the company is counting on fat gross margins of 25% to stay in the black. (Ford by contrast has 10% margins.)
The $28,000 estimate for building the Model 3 “shows there’s some possibility of making money at the low end,” said Gordon. “But it actually doesn’t leave very much [money] per car for all the other expenses. If they’re selling it for less than $50,000, I don’t think it’s a good business.”

I seek to understand the underlying issues myself. What I know so far is that the experienced cave divers managing this rescue wanted Musk to continue working on the sub, not because they were committed to use it but because in an impossible situation you don't discard any possibilities. There is documentation that proves this. 

Vern Unsworth, the person that told Musk to shove the sub up his ass, did not do any diving during the rescue. He appears to be a diver, and may even have dived in this cave, but he didn't have the experience to actually participate in the diving part of the rescue. 

What he did do was extremely important, though, and that was to make the connection between the actual rescue divers and the Thai government. The Thai government's willingness to accept outside help was also pivotal to the success of this rescue. 

Vern Unsworth, when interviewed days after the rescue, was described as still being physically and emotionally exhausted. To me it seems that this exhaustion is what triggered Unsworth's attack against Musk. From Musk's point of view the rescue divers wanted him to build the sub, and yet one person claiming to be a rescue diver told him to shove it up his ass in a very public manner.  

Both parties seemed to be big egos engaged in a dick-slapping contest. I can understand Musk feeling very disrespected for his efforts toward this rescue success, even if the actual rescue divers didn't end up using the sub. Of course, the various fans and anti-fans will seize on just the parts they want to use to support their own personal narratives and agendas. In the end all but one made it out of the cave alive. The hero that died was an experienced diver, his death should illustrate just how dire this situation was.

I used to work at the gigafactory and I heard a story about someone trying to talk to him once. Basically, this guy had a suggestion and wanted to tell Elon (us being production associates I would never walk up to the CEO with one of my ideas, but that’s just me) anyways he walks up to Elon one day that he was at the gigafactory and says he has an idea. Elon looks at him and asks if his idea can fix this (referring to the automated lines). The guys kinda mumbles and says no. Then Elon tells him to fuck off. 

I get that the CEO can’t just listen to every low level employee’s suggestions, but he could have handled it more professionally. That’s why whenever I see him set out to be some sort of real life Tony Stark character I laugh because he does all the things he does for the exact reason the British diver said, publicity stunts. Does he do a lot of good? Yes. But that doesn’t mean he’s the greatest person on the planet.

3108,Sogh,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/thai-cave-rescue-elon-musk-british-diver-vern-unsworth-twitter-pedo-a8448366.html,"> There were two British divers who went in first: Richard Stanton and John Volanthen.

The reason those divers were there is because Unsworth, a lives near the caves, directed the Thai authorities to contact them in the first place. He was in the cave before either of them were even in Thailand. He is the one who told those two divers where to look for the team, and he was within 200m.

> didn't even dive during this incident. 

Citation needed. 

> The way he's described in the article is misleading.

Not at all. He is an expert caver with intimate knowledge of this particular system.

> According to the NYT some passageways in the cave system were enlarged by the divers

To allow a diver with tank to pass through, still not wide enough for Musk's sub and the sub is also rigid so cannot pass through sumps shaped like L or U - of which the cave had several.

>  meaning the difficulties that the pedo was describing was not accurate.

They were accurate, there is no one involved in the rescue agreeing with Musk's claims. Speaking of claims, you just called a man instrumental in rescuing those children a pedo. Citation needed.

> He insults Elon Musk multiple times in the interview unprovoked.

He quite clearly lays out his reasons for criticising him - Musk is a douchebag trying to get publicity out of the situation. That is entirely valid criticism, as Musk has no fucking clue about cave rescues, unlike everyone else involved including Unsworth (who has been involved in several).

> Richard Stanton, literally one of the two guys that dived in before everyone else

False. Unsworth was there before they even arrived. After all, he was the one that called them in as they are well known in the caving world.

> encouraged Elon by email to continue with his efforts and said the sub might be used if the situation got worse.

I have read those emails, the guy was simply being polite. No one involved in the rescue has gone on record saying it was a practical solution given the conditions.

Bottom line - Musk got hurt fee fees because someone called out his douchebaggery, and Musk (and you) responded by calling him a pedo. That says a lot more about you and Musk than it does about a guy who just help save 13 lives.

I can't believe this bullshit post got gilded twice. The fanboys are out in force I guess.

He turned into one of my heroes when I had a small window of opportunity to meet him, simply for demonstrating that he is a decent person who encourages his fans to pursue their dreams. I witnessed him firsthand offering opportunity and work to a talented artist, along with proffering great advice to those who had questions about the art of writing. 
He stayed hours after his event to sign a few thousand autographs, too, which was insanely cool.

First, it was considered libel and slander by the courts, but Tesla couldn't prove any financial damages occurred. the BBC and Jeremy Clarkson claimed Top Gear the show is a satire, and no one would take anything they say seriously. 

The British court threw the case out because Tesla failed to prove that the segment actually caused any damages, despite company claims that the review impacted sales. [Tesla claimed $171,000 in damages from the top gear faked review]

They often gave ""reviews"" of cars which shouldn't be taken very seriously, as they're often not fair or realistic. It did seem like they legitimately were biased against Tesla and electrics in general (""rawr petrol grrrrr vrooom""). Being that Tesla was fighting against monumental pressure to keep electrics from taking hold (oil industry actively stifles progress of technology that competes with oil), I can see why Tesla would sue.

Quite frankly, I think it's justified. And I think there's way too much litigation in the world, and too much attempt at stifling free speech.

>Musk also donates to Democrats (he donates far more to Republicans though), but his donations to Democrats are to a large part to right-wing democrats (Diane Feinstein and Bill Nelson among them) to assist in driving the party to the right. Bill Nelson is the same guy who described single-payer as being ""too good of a deal for the American people"".

>Let me add another one:

>> I attended a dinner discussion a few years ago in Atherton featuring Larry Page and Elon Musk. A small group of Silicon Valley technology leaders attended. I felt out of my depth, but forced myself to ask a question that might elicit patronizing glances. It did.
>> 
>> What would it take to get visionaries like them deeply engaged in the real problems of humanity — poverty, mass incarceration, violence against women — that, because of market failures, don’t offer much money to their solvers?
>> 
>> I was expecting them to discuss market-based solutions, prizes like those the X Prize Foundation and Innocentive are putting up. Prize models have worked well to divert private capital to public solutions, like vaccines.
>> 
>> **Instead, Elon looked at me with a grin and said, “I’m not sure poverty is such a problem. I grew up in South Africa and now live near Beverly Hills. The housewives in my neighborhood are certainly more miserable than the kids I saw playing in the townships growing up. It’s relative.”**
>> 
>> I was so shaken by the absurdity and apocryphal nature of his comments that I didn’t respond for a few minutes. To his credit, Larry did, laughing and pointing out how wrong his friend was. Study after study has demonstrated, through methods like cortisol testing and massive surveys, that **suffering from poverty is only relative above a certain baseline — below this baseline, poverty absolutely causes human suffering. Denying this basic fact is denying the human worth of several billion people on our planet.**

Something like a bunch of batteries and solar panels to help the people there get all the electricity they could need. And, Tesla has the most power-dense batteries in the business. If they could put those great battery cells into some of the equipment, it may offer a worthwhile benefit. I'd imagine that getting 30% more like out of a flashlight would be useful.


I never imagined that Tesla engineers would build a bulky **coffin** and claim it could navigate tight tunnels.

But if that were the case, he didn't act on the chance he had two months ago when shareholders voted on whether to replace him and voted to keep him. He could have dropped hints to the voters—heck his brother is on the board.

I can't tell if you're being sarcastic in these last two examples. The boring industry is well-developed and has been for a very long time. I stand to be corrected/enlightened, so what does Musk's company do that others don't or can't? What large projects have they worked on or completed? 

But the main reason I'm commenting is because you threw the flamethrower thing in there. Are you being serious? It's a glorified weed burner. A toy, basically. It's nothing new, and not even technically a flamethrower. Let alone, a revolutionized version of one.

He's clearly a brilliant dude, but seems really naive about so much shit that should really be very obvious at this point. Like a lot of SpaceX and Tesla stuff. Take the Falcon Heavy, as an example. Until it actually launched earlier this year, for 5 years it was basically constantly ""6 months away because how hard is it to strap three rockets together?"" Literally anybody with any shred of technical experience would tell you that it's actually extremely difficult to do that. Same with Model 3 production issues. It's like this guy just listens to what his interns tell him about production targets and then sticks with that publicly, rather than listening to actual experts. 

""Mr. Musk, I ran this through a spreadsheet and it says if we automate Model 3 production we can have 5000 cars/week produced.""

""Great, when can we automate this by?""

""I don't know anything about automating factories, but I think next week.""

4200,None,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/thai-cave-rescue-elon-musk-british-diver-vern-unsworth-twitter-pedo-a8448366.html,"> Elon has always been a bit of a Trump-ish dude.

I would align with you that they share some qualities. But I wouldn't go so far to calling him a ""Trump-ish dude"".

You see, one key difference is that Trump's goal is to lie and mislead those around him for personal gain. Trump doesn't believe what he says, he has rather adopted lies and absolute disregard for facts as a lifestyle.

While Elon may say many stupid things, be impulsive, and inconsiderate, but he's truly, and I can guarantee you that, he's absolutely drinking his own Kool-Aid. To Elon Musk all of this is not just a con man game. It's not a marketing tactic. Not a reality show. He's believing every single bit of it.

I would liken him more to Steve Jobs. Another person who has been accused of often being blunt with people around him, arrogant at times, and totally buying his own Kool Aid. 

The difference is Trump's after personal gain, and Musk and Jobs may be full of shit, but they'll have tears running down their cheeks talking about their vision and will be willing to die to get there. Which is also what made them successful.

It may also explain why Musk is reacting in this harsh childish way to this British diver. This British diver didn't just say ""Elon's sub wouldn't work"". He said also these things:

- ""He should shove his submarine where it hurts"".
- ""He just came there and they immediately sent him away.""
- ""This was nothing more than a PR stunt.""

Questioning Elon's motives and calling it ""just a PR stunt"" can piss off a guy who is living in his own cult, and truly believes he was there to help (although he probably wouldn't help).

And all of that fits very neatly into his pretty blatant narcissism, this pedo accusation clearly coming from narcissist rage from being called out by the diver guy.",news,t2_1jw9f6nn,8z2i6q,e2g2rqc,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/e2g2rqc/,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/

This is sort of like if you wanted to launch relief supplies with a trebuchet into some earthquake-stricken area with your trebuchet company, and came to me, the head of relief. 

Frankly, the idea is pretty unconventional and shit. But I am definitely going to accept it, because if conventional options fail, something is better than going ""Welp, RIP"". It would literally be unethical of me to not accept the help, especially if it's on the sidelines and isn't impacting our conventional efforts.

Musk tried to constantly draw attention and importance to an extremely unlikely option that would have potentially even resulted in a casualty.

So back to my earthquake example-- Imagine pilots conventionally drop in supplies, some people drop them off on foot to non-viable drop areas, and everything goes ok.

Then you're standing there next to your trebuchet like a twat going ""WE DID IIIIIIIIT""

The reality is you wanted to do a lot, but you didn't do shit and did your best to hog the spotlight from more deserving efforts.

Then comes some diver saying this when Musk talked to divers on the team that got him measurements and this guy says it wouldn't make it 50 yards go shove it up your ass for no good reason really. In Musk's mind this is some expat douchebag that a business insider paid some money to say this shit and yeah as stressed as he is he fired back. Honestly if someone tells you to go fuck yourself you wouldn't respond any other way. Of course I wish he just kept calm because people really overreact to this stuff and use it as an example why he's a bad person when 99% of his actions prove very clearly the opposite. He's been getting attacked hard for decades when he really pours his soul and his entire networth into these risky enterprises and just plainly he's had enough and he's more stressed than usual after the last production hell, that's all this is, it's plainly a very human reaction and people are way overblowing this.

British caver Vern Unsworth, 63, who lives in Chiang Rai, was instrumental in linking up the Thai authorities with the British experts. ""I was actually scheduled to go into the cave on June 24 anyway,"" Unsworth told CNN in an interview in Thailand.""I got all my gear ready, and I was going in to do a solo trip just to see what the water levels were like. And I got called out at 2 o'clock Sunday morning, and I was there for the whole 17 days.""
Unsworth's role in the rescue was also pivotal because of his intimate knowledge of the Tham Luang cave system, which he describes as his ""second home"" after spending the past six years exploring it.

Weak... Lame and Weak.

The rest of the comment does not address my comment in the least. You're saying because I post on the Donald I'm somehow less credible.

You can easily demonstrate the massive change in Reddit's opinion on Elon Musk based on his support of a Republican SuperPAC. 

To say that The_Donald is a hivemind because we support Donald Trump is equivalent to saying /r/gardening is a hivemind because they support gardening.

We're conistent in our support of Donald Trump in the sense that /r/gardening is consistent in their support of the gardening.

The majority of Reddit however, in a short period of time, swings wildly on their opinions of someone based on their political leanings.

So dude, please understand a basic analogy only is as strong the comparison you're making. That sad cabbage you just rolled out there was as weak as that ""heal thyself"" line.

Unsworth *is* a cave diver. He knows that specific cave better than anyone, so if anyone knows whether the sub would work, it would be him. He used his knowledge of the cave to predict where the boys would likely be and told the rescuers where to look for them. They might not have found them in time if not for him.

> British caver Vern Unsworth, 63, who lives in Chiang Rai, was instrumental in linking up the Thai authorities with the British experts. [...] ""I got called out at 2 o'clock Sunday morning, and I was there for the whole 17 days.""

>Unsworth's role in the rescue was also pivotal because of his intimate knowledge of the Tham Luang cave system, which he describes as his ""second home"" after spending the past six years exploring it.

>He had been involved in cave rescue operations in the UK before, but ""nothing on this scale.""

>It was Unsworth who initally pinpointed where he thought the Wild Boars team would be waiting. They were found 200 meters away from that point, which was ""probably around about the best place they could have been,"" he said.

If someone told me to stick it up my ass, I would then have to stoop to his level to respond in kind, which is what Elon did.

I'm no Elon fanboy but I think it is wrong to put Elon on a pedestal where we expect different behavior from him than any other human.

I don't think it's just the comment by itself. I think it's the fact that, Elon Musk wanted to do something good, and offered his help, and then this guy just craps all over it and calls it a PR stunt. That would infuriate me, especially if I'm genuinely trying to help.

>Does it say more about the diver who said it, or more about Musk who can't even take a simple, cliche insult?

It's up to who you ask. I can see why Musk said what he said, he must have been infuriated. He could have chosen his words more wisely, but I can understand that he'd be angry.

I myself am self-employed, and I run my own little business, I think of myself as a problem solver, and so I can personally relate more to Elon Musk in this case. I've had people poo-poo my ideas, and it can be aggravating as fuck, especially if you spend a lot of time and thought on something, and it's perfectly human to feel proud of what you did and want to show it off.

I did not get the sense that Elon Musk was trying to be pushy with his idea. If I recall correctly he said, ""well, maybe it's useful, maybe not, but either way, it's here if you guys need it."" And then this guy suddenly shits all over Elon Musk's idea and calls it a PR stunt on TV. That would infuriate the fuck out of me.

The diver's comments must have hit me harder than it would have hit other people I guess. Other people are like, ""oh well the diver didn't say anything that bad"", well, to you maybe, but to me, as someone who is self-employed, I could feel the stinging of that comment.

Am I saying what Elon Musk said was okay? No, no I'm not, but you're probably going to think that I am no matter what I say. I'm not excusing him, but I am empathizing with him, because I know how personally frustrating it is when people just brush you aside and poo poo your ideas like you're nothing, when you may genuinely want to help.

> Thailand is a source, destination, and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking. Thai victims of trafficking and some of the estimated three to four million migrant workers in Thailand are forced, coerced, or defrauded into labor or sex trafficking. Some labor trafficking victims are exploited in commercial fishing and related industries, factories, agriculture, and domestic work, or forced into street begging. Migrant workers who are trafficking victims may be deported without effective screening for indicators of trafficking. Sex trafficking remains a significant problem in Thailand’s extensive commercial sex industry. <",news,t2_1jw9f6nn,8z2i6q,e2gjrqg,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/e2gjrqg/,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/
