87,None,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/thai-cave-rescue-elon-musk-british-diver-vern-unsworth-twitter-pedo-a8448366.html,"So did Elon only do this for publicity? If not, he sure became defensive with that hell of a knee-jerk reaction. Nobody knew Vern Unsworth before Elon decided to attack him. Unsworth's criticism of Elon would have gone pretty much unheard had Elon not responded in such an extreme way. It makes you wonder why he is so sensitive about being called out by someone with much less publicity and much more experience.


And speaking of Unsworth's experience, he both accurately predicted the location that the kids would hide in, and then he found them. This man knows the cave like the back of his hand, living nearby and having explored it extensively. Those children would not be with their families right now if not for Mr. Unsworth. He was searching for them from the beginning and did so without any need for publicity. Most people wouldn't even know his name if Elon hadn't started this beef with him.


So what did Unsworth say that was so hurtful and threatening to a multi-billionaire CEO? 


> He can stick his submarine where it hurts. It had absolutely no chance of working. He had no conception of what the cave passage was like. The submarine, I believe, was about five foot six long, rigid, so it wouldn’t have gone round corners or round any obstacles. It wouldn’t have made the first 50 metres into the cave from the dive start point. Just a PR stunt.


And what did that multi-billionaire say in reply? Basically, through many tweets, that Mr. Unsworth is a pedophile for living in Thailand, and hardly helped with the rescure.


Honestly, I trust the opinion of an expert diver who is very familiar with this cave more than I trust the opinion of Elon Musk, who has experience with nothing related.


I think that we need to trust CEOs much less that we do in general. Reddit was infatuated with Elon Musk for a while. People need to remember that corporations are not friends, and that the primary interest of a CEO is to do what is in the best interests of their company. 


Think of companies as profit machines. Their only purpose to calculate the best way to increase their own profitability. Elon, the mascot of his businesses, looks at this situation as a way to increase the positive publicity of his brand, and thus increase its income. There is no doubt that joining the rescue mission was not a passionate decision by Elon, but rather a calculated decision involving many people looking at spreadsheets to determine the potential losses versus potential profits. Hypothetically, if a CEO used his company money to finance a rescue mission on the other side of the world without it being documented, or popular, and without public attention, that CEO would be seen as a bad businessman and probably sacked. 


**It is estimated that Elon has over 20 billion dollars. If Elon was truly so passionate about saving random people on the other side of the planet, I am sure he could find some way to improve the lives of the many starving children in Africa, or to pay his empolyees a living wage, or maybe he could just spend some of his money to improve the conditions in his factories somewhat.** This WAS a PR move. Like all PR moves it was manipulative, and it would have worked if Elon Musk were not such a hot head. 


Cue his empty apology once he realizes that attacking an actual hero isn't a good PR move.


Cue his PR team lurking the internet trying to put out this fire he started.",news,t2_1jw9f6nn,8z2i6q,e2gn6eg,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/e2gn6eg/,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/

That's total nonsense.

The difference between UK and US libel laws that you're referring to here is that in the UK you have to be able to prove what you said was true to win a libel case, whereas in the US the person you libeled has to prove it was false in order to win. The main difference is who carries the burden of proof to win the case.

You have never been able to successfully sue someone for libel in the UK for an accusation that was (provably) true just ""because it harms [your] character"".",news,t2_1jw9f6nn,8z2i6q,e2g9ox4,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/e2g9ox4/,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/

They ran the Roadster down behind the scenes to imply it ran out of battery charge during recording and focused heavily on negative points doing harm to a company that relies on word of mouth.

1. About the brakes (which your comment is missing): The car's brakes breaking was not scripted. Tesla says they didn't break because the brakes still worked, you just had to press far harder than normal because a fuse went out. Now I'm not sure about you, but to me that'd qualify as broken and you'd also get a hefty fine for not getting a fault like that repaired. Just imagine your brakes failing without warning like that in a real-world scenario.

2. Top Gear said: ""It's been calculated that at the track the car would run out after 55 miles"" instead of saying ""It ran out"". The 55 mile number came from Tesla themselves: 

 >""The first point here is that the track is where we do our tests of sports cars and supercars, as has happened ever since Top Gear existed. This is where cars are driven fast and hard, and since Tesla calls its roadster ""The Supercar. Redefined."" it seemed pretty logical to us that the right test was a track test. **The second point is that the figure of 55 miles came not from our heads, but from Tesla's boffins in California. They looked at the data from that car and calculated that, driven hard on our track, it would have a range of 55 miles.**""

  https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/30/tesla-sue-top-gear

 Literally the only scripted part was them pushing the car off the track after saying that it's been calculated (by Tesla!) to run out of electricity after 55 miles. They do this sort of stuff with many, many other cars. When they had the V12 Jaguar XJS on the show, it was presented in such a way that they couldn't finish a sentence while driving before having to stop for gas, again.

Tesla then claimed they found out they only drove it around the track for 5km, not 44km, and the battery never actually died.

The thing was, Top Gear got their 44km number *from Tesla.*  They sent *them* the 5km of driving data and asked ""if we kept driving like this how long would the battery last"" and Tesla told them ""about 44km"".

He remained in the cave until the last of the rescuers were out & then made his journey to the surface where he learnt that during his time in Thailand, his own father had passed away.

In his own words [“If we hadn’t called them in then, it would have been too late.” (£)](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/7fa1253c-87a2-11e8-b2f0-2eea66149d47) 
 
Edit: for info behind the paywall. 
Vernon Unsworth, 63yr old financial broker, develops love of caving and potholing in the Yorkshire Dales.

Currently resides near Tham Luang in Thailand and has spent much time exploring the subterranean complex and consequently knows it very well. 

Mr Unsworth is a cave explorer but *not* a diver. Hence, after three fruitless days of attempted exploration by the Thai Navy Seals divers who lacked cave know-how or the equipment to combat the perilous conditions, he used his phone book to put the Thai authorities in touch with John Volanthen & Rick Stanton. 

The article names these two as the “best cave divers in the world”. 

Equipped with Vernon Unsworth’s unparalleled knowledge of this “seven mile” cave system (he knew which chambers would already have been flooded & in which there would have a chance of refuge) Volanthen & Stanton set about searching for the boys and their coach.

It took another 5 days before the boys and coach were discovered. 

The article goes on to describe the parlous condition of the area in which the football team took shelter & the hugely complex rescue.

It further describes the legendary Aussie anaesthetist & cave diver (presumably on his own in the area where that Venn diagram overlaps?) and how sedating the boys prior to “swimming” them out was a decision only made when all other options were exhausted. 

The article is really lengthy; I’m sorry that it’s behind a paywall & that I’ve now run out of time to do a proper, succinct tl;dr.

Everyone involved seems pretty inspirational to me. Calling anyone a paedophile without evidence seems a desperate & ghastly thing to do.

I like that he's in this world and getting things done, but people think he is like Nikola Tesla, he's not, he is literally a business guy with pretty bad public speaking, but he understands people and is a seriously top notch hype machine.

Musk is kinda odd in terms of actual job/work compared to his image and people are getting more polarizing on him for simple reasons:

he's kinda talked about like he's Wozniak (brilliant inventor and engineer who seems like the kindest most compassionate dude ever for anyone who isn't in the loop), but he's not, he's Steve Jobs. 

the inventions him and his companies make are rarely innovative in the way it is portrayed (well, maybe not space x, i don't know enough to say that there), he has taken big risks and done well with them, but most companies have the the small sorts of innovations that his companies are praised for (because he's good at PR), i.e, the tesla battery pack everyone sees as some amazing innovative thing? it's literally just a box of 18650 batteries, if you don't know what they are, they're basically bigger versions of AA batteries, they're everywhere. literally, it's a box of normal batteries. it might be cheaper and a good business choice, but it's not innovative. 

space x is full of some of the smartest people there is... and i really hope that space x keeps doing well, but fuck him for the way he treats his employees. it should never be a gift to simply have the opportunity to work for a company to the point that it comes at a cost to the person working there. they are the driving force.

They were hedging their bets, and felt that if the rain situation had deteriorated as expected that they would need the sub to rescue some of the sicker boys. Remember, several of these kids had pneumonia already by the time rescuers were ready to start the rescue, and as anyone who has dived can tell you, diving with pneumonia can be very deadly. As it turned out, the weather cooperated and they were able to effect their primary rescue strategy. BTW, did you know that the pump they were using to keep water levels stable failed shortly after the last kids got out? The cave flooded almost instantly and the remaining divers had to dump their gear and flee for their lives, barely getting out in time.

I think Musk shouldn't have been so public with his contributions to this, mainly because his detractors (most of whom couldn't give two shits about the kids or the rescue) would use it as ammunition for yet more attacks.

I don't think it was reasonable at all to assume the marketing of this project is equal to the cash he dropped on it on zero notice. The positive publicity may have pushed him over the edge of considering it to doing it, but I don't think any kind of market projection could show it would be a worthwhile business move on its own, which is the major argument seems to be against him. If all he really cared about was the PR, he should have been pointing out how much of the traditional rescue operation was heavily supported by his donations, and trying to insinuate that even this approach wouldn't have worked without his help. Now, after taking lots of abuse, he did something colossally stupid. There's no endorsing it, but I think it makes sense.

Something that's important to remember here is that **none of this was about Elon Musk**. The operation was about getting the kids out safely. Elon Musk was not entitled to the time and resources of the rescue team just because he wanted to help. The rescue team didn't owe him a personal liaison to answer any and all questions about the cave. Giving those resources to Musk means pulling those resources away from other areas.

When a team of people are working tirelessly to save a bunch of kids, it's not an appropriate time to stamp your feet and yell ""What about me!!! What about my ideas!!!"".

Vern Unsworth is a caver, British expat living in the area. Early in the search and rescue when the SEALs realized they couldn’t handle the conditions, he suggested the British cave diving rescue people.

The clarity has been poor because the focus was on the work, not documenting everything. The Press really was very poor in not having any idea of cave rescue issues and secondary press that republished stories snowballed errors by adding drama. A lot of the incorrect pronouncements came from people who declared themselves to be spokespeople (the ex governor) or insiders (eg Vern Unsworth) and their credentials were exaggerated. Besides the cave conditions, the scope for management conflict was horrific. Take the Thai Navy SEALs for example. For ego reasons they needed to feel in charge and were pumped up all the time to be as capable as US SEALs. No one addressed the simple question: Do Thai Navy SEALs have ANY cave diving experience?
The fact that they let the foreign divers tackle the problem and played a logistical support role was quite amazing.

I just don't like people jumping to conclusions and then selling it as fact in general. I'm also not a fan of people selling their opinions as facts. The guy on the interview has clearly no idea if the submarine fits or not. He hasn't tried it and has no evidence to back his claims up. He just wanted to bash Musk and provoke him.

This guy apperently spent 6 years exploring the cave and he has no 3D map of it yet. Just vague descriptions from his memory and some notes. What kind of a study is this? Has anyone actually checked his background? Is this guy even a legitimate scientist or whatever he claims to be?

We are talking about Elon Musk, not Nikola Tesla. Unless you are referring to ""'Tesla' electric car company"" as ""Elon Musk"". 

>You're just naming areas that he's invested in and then claiming that he's dominating them.

You are trying to downplay his accomplishments by trying to say that he is merely an ""investor"" in other areas. Elon Musk created, owns, and operates a private civilian company(SpaceX) that shoots rockets into space and one of their clients is USAF(which is a good client to have). He has also created, owns, and operates a mass-producing electric car company. He virtually created the mass-produced electric car industry because no one in the auto industry was talking about mass producing electric cars until Tesla came about.

Bullshit, he made the resuce happen. The guy isnt a diver, he is a pretty expert caver, he was there the first day the kids were missing because he had planned a cave trip, goes there all the time and lives nearby.

HE CONVINCED thais to call in expert divers he explicitly and urgently named. Then he helped by providing clear maps, directions and had the correct first guess to boys locations. Fuck off.

https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/13/uk/thai-cave-rescue-british-divers-intl/index.html

Vern Unsworth is the diver that attacked Musk. The article implies that Unsworth has some cave diving experience, but makes it clear that Unsworth knew he didn't have what it would take to do the rescue dives himself. He did advise the Thai government to seek out the divers that did end up being pivotal. At the end of the ordeal Unsworth was an important part of the rescue, just not an important diver in the rescue.

> Chatting to CNN in a leafy café north of Chiang Rai, Unsworth appeared exhausted physically and emotionally, and is still reeling from the outcome of the rescue.

What it seems to me is that Unsworth also has a big ego, and for whatever reason just took a dislike to Musk, probably just a classic case of two big egos getting into a dick-slapping contest. Unsworth's mental and physical exhaustion is probably what triggered his comment to Musk.

After a battery of 8 separate interviews over six hours, the only clear expectation that they had was that an employee live and breathe *the mission* because, and I quote, ""We're still a startup just trying to get our footing as a company, we need dedicated employees first and foremost who are dedicated to our success.""

After 15 years as a company, at what point do you stop being a *startup* and start just being a struggling company? Their offer was *only* tempting because of the name recognition in future job searches. It certainly wasn't the pay, working conditions, or office atmosphere which was just as disturbingly cultish on the East Coast as I hear they are on the West Coast.

In Musk's case its the same, just with  higher-skill professions, but still one where its an employer's market.

Several people here have mentioned that his engineers are well-compensated and I don't doubt that.

Musk was asked to continue the sub project by the actual rescue divers, which makes sense because they were hedging their bets. Though his contribution of the sub ended up not being used, that effort was still meaningful, and Unsworth's attack was pretty much in bad faith, especially since the fact is he wasn't involved in the rescue dives at all.

No, he wasn't. His critical contribution to the rescue is very important, though, he's the one that connected the Thai government with the actual cave divers who did the rescue. In that, Vern Unworth's contributions were indeed very important. He was not one of the rescue divers, and it's not that clear he's even a cave diver at all.

It's pretty accurate. That scenario played out a lot (buying a startup just to disband it to prevent it becoming competition). He would also repeatedly abuse Microsoft's market position to cripple competitors who had better products, eventually getting Microsoft repeatedly crucified by both the EU and the US, and nearly broken up.

Damning document here from an EU body, detailing all of Microsoft's bad behaviour over the years. Worth reading the entire thing, but a very quick tl;dr is to scan the italicized quotes from Gates and co. at the start of each section, which incriminate them better than I ever could. http://www.ecis.eu/documents/Finalversion_Consumerchoicepaper.pdf

His practices were, for the most part, directed business-to-business: for example, I can't recall MS under his tenure displaying anything like Zuckerberg's ""dumb fucks"" attitude to exploiting users. But the anti-competitive behaviours severely negatively affected users and the progress of technology, as collateral damage, in ways we felt even decades after.

You can ask any medical or law professional and they will tell you the same thing. Pedophilia is, by definition, a mental disorder that causes an individual to feel sexually attracted to children, and disorders cannot be crimes, otherwise people would get thrown in prison for things they have little or no control over. The crime pedophilia causes is called child sexual abuse. Just like kleptomania and pyromania, in and of itself, aren't crimes because they're mental disorders, but they cause theft and arson which *are* crimes.

I assume this refers to the comments made by the diver, and here there absolutely was a reason.

There are so many ways someone like Musk could have actually helped the situation, like donating money to the rescue effort, the neighboring farmers whose land and crops were flooded by the pumps the rescuers, to the boys' families and the family of the diver who drawned, and so on and so forth.

I love a lot of the ultimate goals of the various Musk enterprises. I also love Musks' overall trend of using his money for good (usually). 

But I am uneasy at this generally combative and defensive posture that Musk has increasingly taken. It worries me because it looks as though his skin is getting dangerously thin. I think a possibility of more grandstanding on his part may very well undercut the efficacy of his attempts to help. Helping is good, but just getting in the way while trying to help isn't good. I worry his apparent need to seem relevant and benevolent may reduce the overall good he could do (and seemingly *wants* to do).

Also, on a similar note, some of my worry stems from the fact I think he took too much credit for the technological success of the SpaceX program.

He was the first caver on site. He was the one who called in the two UK experts. He had mapped the cave previously. He directed the two other divers to where he thought the kids were - he was right. And so on.

I never claimed he was the sole person responsible, but he was one of the major players.

> Second. Elon is very hard working,

Who gives a shit.

> if he is confronted with a problem then he works really really hard to beat it.

No, he pays [non-unionised labour under shitty conditions](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/18/tesla-workers-factory-conditions-elon-musk) to beat the problem. 

> When some one with that type of worth ethic

What work ethic? Are you claiming he has more of a work ethic than a single mother working 3 jobs just to pay the basics for her family? Why are you claiming that Musk has some unique work ethic that makes it ok for him to call someone a pedo?

> throws MASSIVE amounts of time, energy, and money at a problem

It was a few days work using second hand parts from other projects. It was also completely useless.

> someone rights his efforts off as a “PR stunt” and “shove his submarine where it hurts”.

It was a PR stunt and he should shove it up there. It was a useless device made purely so Musk could get some PR and appeal to his cult. People like you it seems.

> That is really demeaning.

What is demeaning is risking your life in the caves while some loud douchebag sends you a useless toy and claims to be saving the kids. Unsworth was right to tell Musk where to put it.

> Especially since he seems to be one of the only people who has serious amounts of money who cares enough to help in similar crisis situations. 

People like Gates and Buffet have done more than Musk ever has or will. Thousands of people are alive who would otherwise be dead because of those guys. 

> I know the sub idea didn’t work. That probably didn’t bother him. 

And that's the point. He had no interest in the actual rescue and just wanted his name in the papers. His junk yard vanity project had zero chance of working before a single bolt was tightened.

> I know he probably wasn’t gonna get any credit for the rescue

Good, because he did fuck all to help.

>  even though he brought in really powerful pumps and batteries.

No he didn't.

> But when someone goes on the news just to insult the man for caring enough to try.

Once again, because he wasn't trying to help. He was trying to get PR for himself and Tesla. Once again, the sub would never have worked.

> I can completely understand why he exploded the way he did. 

You think calling Unsworth (a hero whose name you didn't even know until Musk smeared him) a pedo is understandable?

You are a terrible person.

Wouldn't you get angry if some smug know it all would devalue your work like that?

Elon *wants* to help people, but he has no idea how. 

He’s said himself, his philosophy is based on Douglas Adams and Isaac Asimov and all of that. He thinks we live in this world where the most pressing issues are human solar expansion and colonisation, but the truth is people are starving, people can’t afford chemotherapy, the health system in the US is fucked, there’s a colossal gulf of wealth that’s systematically destroying the entire civilised world from the bottom up.

Not to say I expect Elon to fix these things, and I fully acknowledge how much he wants to help and I think he is going to make a difference to a lot of people. But just look at hyperloop- he invented what’s essentially a bus that only rich people can use, because it’s cool and science fiction-y. He means well, but he’s just so detached from the realities of the struggles of the working class that he honestly doesn’t know what to do.

His wealth has more immediate and pressing places it could go that would help more people than space, essentially. Because that’s nice and even important but it’s not the priority at the moment. And we need people who are willing to think about space and all that, because they are exciting and important, but people need to get over this idea that he’s going to be the messiah of the human race. If his only goal was singlemindedly to save lives, he’d be negotiating healthcare and debt and housing, not sending cars into space and building rockets and submarines.",news,t2_1jw9f6nn,8z2i6q,e2g874l,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/e2g874l/,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/

Fwiw when he said them out loud he preceded them with ""Musk can stick his submarine where it hurts."" Not that that makes what Musk said okay in any way. I mean sure they were probably better off not using it but he didn't need to start with insults either.

To be honest what Musk did was incredibly childish. What Musk said was not okay in any way and he should be ashamed of himself. I hope he apologizes and he should have some consequences to his actions. 

That being said I don't necessarily think that Mr. Unsworth was innocent in all of this either. He did throw the first insult publicly afaik. Not to the same degree or anything but still noteworthy.

And that's the primary thing they sued over. Had they actually ran the battery down they would have realized that the only way to strand yourself is to ignore a bunch of escalating audible warnings and speed throttles (I think at the last stretch it limits you to like 20 mph). It is far easier to accidentally run out of fuel in a gasoline car.

Yet Top Gear felt the need to mislead their audience about the dangers of running out of juice in an electric car (on a track no less where they would have had to do multiple laps under speed limitation to get it to fully run out). There are a lot of misconceptions about electric cars out there because they are unfamiliar to most people so many might take what they saw as real. Whereas a Jaguar running out of gas every sentence is obviously hyperbole and people know that because they are familiar with gasoline vehicles.

The one I find particularly interesting is the part where he says the sub had no chance of working because Musk didn't know what the cave passage was like. He has also described himself as one of the foremost experts on these caves, and he is credited with coordinating the rescue efforts. Musk has shown that he was in communication with rescue coordinators trying to get as much information as he could about the caves and what they thought would be effective. Somehow Unsworth was unable to communicate what the caves were like to Musk. Perhaps if he had been more interested in getting the kids out than cutting Musk out of the loop, there would have been a better strategy offered.

Edit: And on this topic, I'd like to add 2 highly upvoted comments from the /r/worldnews post that got removed for no reason. From /u/LeDankRedditUserxD:

>If anyone else was insulting the rescue chief and now also one of the divers as a ""pedo"", people would go crazy. But because it is Elon Musk, surely he must know better than all the experts. And this isn't the first time this has happened. Musk called Jarrett Walker [(who is a quite renowned transit expert with decades of experience)](https://medium.com/transit-app/the-man-who-makes-transit-systems-better-overnight-28f7b1699eb0) a [""sanctimonious idiot"", and Musk's sycophant cult following immediately started attacking Walker as well.](https://i.imgur.com/cY6mI2d.png) Some people are just beyond help. 

>The only person who I've seen have a similar cult following is Trump, but at least those people are mostly contained to t_D and similar subs. Musk's cult following has infested a lot of default subs, especially /r/futurology and /r/technology, but also subs like /r/news or /r/worldnews. At least you can still call out Musk here without immediately getting downvoted to hell – try doing it in a place /r/futurology – but even here there is a frightening amount of comments attacking the divers who saved those kids because they dared criticise their dear leader.

And /u/MakerMuperMaster (this was the comment I got the picture from):

>At this point I doubt the Musk worshipping is organic. [Tesla alone spends over $60 million per year on ads and marketing](http://ir.tesla.com/static-files/0fbefe56-326c-412e-a33c-aa1b342e9469), but have you ever actually seen a Tesla ad? Nope. They know their audience, and making social media manipulation look like it's just organic praise is a shit ton more effective than spending that money on TV ads. It's especially suspicious when posts like these hit the front page:

When my mother in law died, most conversations immediately following her life support being turned off was bitching about a coworker of hers crying excessively. Her husband, sister, mother, and children all remarked on how inappropriate they thought it was that her coworker was so loudly crying in public around people who were family of the dying woman who were much more stoic. Many said she was doing it for attention. These people aren't sociopaths, they just come from a lower middle class area where loud public displays of emotion are discouraged, even if you are literally watching your daughter, mother or spouse die.

While my MIL was ill I once snapped on my wife because she started crying and burned some gravy we were cooking. It was tense several weeks that were emotionally exhausting and I just didn't have any patience or empathy left at that moment and was starving and just wanted the food not to be ruined.

Another example is this: https://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/update-4-the-price-of-cutting-off-analysts-for-tesla-its-2-billion

A financial analyst asked Musk about Tesla's financials *during an earnings call*, and Musk promptly labelled it a ""boring bonehead question"", ended the call and spent the rest of the time answering questions from a YouTube fanboy of his.

a lot of these pictures can also be taken out of context, replies to twitter etc, ex. the donation one about anonymous donations can mean incredibly different if we’d know to what he replied to.

in the end elon is a tech billionaire that wants to reshape and redefine the future, help others to an extend of what he thinks is helping and just experiment with various things, of course not everything works but thats with everyone doing what he does. Its the media that immediately jumps on it just because it has his name on it, and depending how its written he could be portrayed as god or devil. 

we dont hear about Jeff Bezos much for example, he could be doing way greater or way shittier things, or its just more neutral written thus less sensational and reaching less people.

if you think about his 38k donation to super PAC? its a donation he made to its democratic equivalent as well, its politics regardless what you think or not, tons of back hand lobbyists do donations to keep channels open regardless whats done with them, and the others that have done the same are things not being heard about.

people fighting against his glorification are just as bad as the ones treating him as a god, just treat him based on his actions and think for yourself instead of copying other people or articles their opinion.

The wording is very interesting. 70% come specifically for sex tourism. So what percent have used a prostitute at least once but also went for something like diving? 90%?

> Even when they could talk to each other, searchers did not know where to look or how to find their way. The SEALs would find themselves essentially lost after hours-long dives, with still no sign of the young boys. On June 27, fast-rising waters filled the cave — so fast that it was the equivalent of a house flooding in 10 minutes. 

> “Our three hours of draining became nothing,” the Thai navy commander said. 

> They found help from an unlikely expert. 

> Vernon Unsworth, a British insurance consultant and hobbyist spelunker, has made an obsession of the Tham Luang cave system. He had explored miles of it over a decade, planning his travels between England and Thailand around the rainy season. He was convinced that the Thais were looking in the wrong place. Unsworth had strong views on where to look and who should be doing the looking. 

> “Time is running out,” he wrote in a letter to the governor, according to Unsworth’s wife. He listed the names of three British cave divers he pegged as the best in the world. “Please contact them through UK Embassy ASAP.”

> The Thai government agreed. 

> Within days, his Brits were in the cave, and a search that most had given up as futile took an electrifying turn. 

> On July 2, Rick Stanton, a former firefighter, and John Volanthen, an IT consultant, used Unsworth’s maps to reach a chamber more than 2.5 miles from the entrance. When their headlamps emerged from the water, they reflected in 13 pairs of eyes that had not seen sunlight in more than 200 hours.

It's just annoying how media hypes up these people, the the degree where they stop being people but instead become some sort of symbols for tech, innovation, and even the future. 

Especially since media is often completely clueless about tech and science, and the people they hype up often aren't nearly as innovative and tech-savy as media paints them out - They tend to be mostly PR-people holding the money bag, while the actual innovation and tech magic is done by the engineers, inventors and designers who's slaving away in the offices - ie. very much like in every other tech company out there.

Read this article and then reply. Secondly, Elon Musk’s companies aren’t as perfect as you may think. Don’t get me wrong, he has done remarkable things but to act as if he’s some sort of god who deserves unwavering respect is utter fanboy bullshit.  Elon Musk is a man who has been acting out of line in the past few months on twitter and his behaviour is constantly being defended yet he is clearly in the wrong. In this particular case he goes out of his way to try and discredit a man who has put in commendable effort into helping save those kids just because the practicability of his submarine has been questioned. And rightfully so, it would never have worked. There are several sections in the cave where even the divers had to remove gear just to navigate. Tell me, would you rather take advice and direction from a professional in a fields with hands on experience or rather a billionaire with a PR goal who simply disregards the views of experts on the scene. Elon Musk is showing signs of faltering mental fortitude,just look at his tweet history, and I absolutely refuse to respect a man like that. To try and degrade someone’s name by calling them a paedophile is unacceptable and incredibly childish. But if that’s your hero then so be it.

I mean, ive never been so insecure that my response to criticism was that the person that said it fucked children. And besides even if i did itd be irrelevant. In some anonymous person on the internet, Musk is a massive public figure so comparing the two is frankly stupid. 

> Instead it turns to ""OMG ELON IS LITERALLY HITLER OMGZZZZZ WE GOT HIM NOW FINALLY!!!!"" 

Ive been following this story pretty closely and ive seen literally no one call Or compare elon to hitler. 

>Just like the ""grab em by the pussy"" comment in a bus must automatically mean Trump is Ted Bundy.

No, when trump has been credibly accused of sexual assault but like a dozen people and then a tape comes out where he openly says he’s sexually assaulted people in the past, its not too big a leap to believe the women.

It's a harsh opinion, yet I see where it comes from. That guy, Vern, is the pro diver with invaluable knowledge of these caves, he walked and crawled them, he knows what will fit there and what not. The slightest mistake in cave diving costs you life, he knows it better than anyone. And there are 13 lives at stake, every hour pushes them closer to the end.

There are places in that cave where a man hardly squeezes himself through, it's partly flooded partly dried, mud and sharp rock and twisted turns all the way - pushing that metal coffin, even if it could be squeezed through, would be nightmare. And yet Musk still defends his idea and insists that sub would work.

Ask the President. Oh wait you said billionaires, my bad. 

Musk has form in this area, he got sued over one of his tweets before by the UAW. But I think he will go with the [Barr Excuse.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/872260000491593728) 

> would a billionaire have access that an ordinary person wouldn't? 

Repeat after me - he is not Tony Stark. He does not have super or psychic powers. 

So no, he does not have access to information that the UK or Thai police do not have and neither have arrested Unsworth. If he does have evidence, he should present it immediately as otherwise he would be aiding a pedo to escape justice. So either way, Musk is full of shit until he provides his evidence.

> i don't care for musk one way or the other. 

You cared enough to claim that a guy responsible for rescuing a dozen kids is a pedo. Without evidence.

>he called the guy responsible for the rescues a pedo 

The way that is written defiantly conveys he was the sole person responsible for the rescues (doesn’t seem like a big thing but you seem to like to bring up things that don’t matter)

>who gives a shit 

Probably his employees since he grew the companies they work at big enough to give them a career 

> No, he pays non-unionised labour under shitty conditions to beat the problem.

Elon is Notorious for working consistent 100 hour weeks. I don’t get why you brought up what he pays his workers when I said “he works really hard”. You’d be lying if you said 100 hour work week is not hard. 

> Are you claiming he has more of a work ethic than a single mother working 3 jobs

I’m SUPER confused where you pulled this random hypothetical situation from. You are just trying to insult the man and belittle his accomplishments

> Why are you claiming that Musk has some unique work ethic that makes it ok for him to call someone a pedo?

I defiantly never said this. Again he works upwards of 100 hours a week. Just to name a few accomplishments Tesla, SpaceX, Paypal, OpenAI, and countless others. The man insulted him ON TV to thousands of people. Just because he helped rescue those boys does not make him invulnerable to a counter insult (even though I don’t personally think it was right) 

> It was a few days work using second hand parts from other projects. It was also completely useless.

If people trying to help in a crisis situation is a bad thing and completely useless I have no faith in humanity. Plus he flew out to the cave, meet with experts in different fields. A lot more then “a few days of work”

> It was a PR stunt and he should shove it up there.

Ok in what world during a PR STUNT WOULD A PERSON USE AN INSULT AGAINST A DIVER WHO HELPED. It can’t possibly be a PR stunt since he is so sincere  and obviously cares enough to get mad about it. If it was a PR stunt by a corporate team this post wouldn’t be here right now because they wouldn’t have said anything.

>appeal to his cult. 

I guess people like other people who try and make the world a better place. 

> What is demeaning is risking your life in the caves

*you try to hide the fact that he insulted the man on tv by changing the subject to his accomplishment*

>blah blah blah bill gates 

Yes bill gates sets up charities and donates but when do you see him jump in with engineers and scientists to help in really specific situations. 

> Once again, because he wasn't trying to help. He was trying to get PR for himself and Tesla. Once again, the sub would never have worked.

Once again you change the subject from the fact the diver insulted him to cry “he was trying to get pr” 

> You think calling Unsworth (a hero whose name you didn't even know until Musk smeared him) a pedo is understandable?

Actually I didn’t even know his name until you said it, I don’t know how to pronounce it, and I’ll forget it by tomorrow morning. I digress 
The diver started all this. He could’ve taken the credit but he went on TV to smear Elon’s name. You actually typed that like unsworth didn’t do or say anything and Elon insulted him out of no where. Elon sent a tweet the diver was on TV broadcasting to thousands 

All in all I think Elon’s genuine and you cant actually think this is a PR stunt since so many people are hating him right now. I’m not trying to take away from the accomplishments of other men but the diver insulted him first, he deserves some back. 

> You are a terrible person.

I don’t know how we got to insulting each other but, no u

Musk congratulated everyone involved and donated his sub to the Thais so that they can maybe use some other time. 

I'm not sure where it started but I think it was a news website that quoted a former government official saying that Musk's submarine was impractical. Musk than said that the guy who they quoted was not informed enough to make such a statement. The true rescue leader who they were in contact with said they appreciate any help and encouraged them to go on. Musk copy and pasted their email conversation on Twitter. This is where many many media outlets started to bash on Musk, saying he would do it for the PR and so on for no reason.

Then butthurt CNN came along with an interview of a Brit that lived in Thailand for several years who had explored the cave before. He was not one of the divers but he still helped to find the kids with his knowledge. Great, but for some unknown reason he started to bash Musk as well. Saying he could stick his submarine where it hurts. To even publish such an obviously unprofessional and not reputable interview had no value other than to damage Musk. 

My conclusion is CNN wanted to trap Musk because they saw how emotional he got. They sadly achieved their goal and it escalated in him accusing the Brit. 

I dont defend Musk for what he said, it was stupid, but what CNN did was much much worse. They are the PR whores who helped noone, not Musk. Musk bent metal as they say. It weren't just words. They build a small submarine that can fit through the cave despite what anyone speculates. Everyone saying it can't fit has obviously not data to back his claims up.  

Either way, it didn't hurt anyone and Musk's SpaceX team need the training to rapidly design rescue solutions for future space mission.s They put their training efforts to good use.

>While billionaire and would-be Mars coloniser Elon Musk responded to news of the trapped Thai football team and their coach by tweeting each stage of his attempt to invent a miniature submarine that could also be used as an escape pod in outer space, by the time he had dropped off his contraption at the cave’s entrance, the rescuers had already started retrieving the boys using … a rope.
“The equipment they brought to help us is not practical with our mission,” authorities noted. Undeterred, Musk tweeted: “Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future.”
The image we are left with is one of a man whose internal dialogue runs like a best-bits montage of Scrapheap Challenge, Tomorrow’s World and an OK Go video: a chap who looks at the concept of using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut and deduces that the problem with this whole scenario lies in the design of the sledgehammer – not enough titanium in the handle, nothing in the way of flashing lights, little use in an interplanetary space mission, no aux socket. Arriving at the test site, he discovers the walnut has long since been carted off by a squirrel.

Good PR makes more money than you'd think. Musk is the public face of all of his businesses.

We need increased tech. It becomes cheaper and easier for everyone to access in the future. Its a butterfly effect that touches everything in our life now and going forward, even if we can't quantify it now. A lot of the issues you mention have been or can be solved. We can't expect billionaires to fix our problems like you mention, so when one offers help, we should be grateful or at least not disrespectful; we want more in the future, right? Elon is definitely no Messiah, just a smart hard-working guy trying solve a few problems.

Last I read there is no food shortage. It's an issue of delegation and delivery and government. We have enough food to feed everyone. We have a surplus of food, even. GMOs will make this even more so in the future. 

Who can't get chemo? Last I checked, most people are getting chemo if required. Any problems here should be handled and rectified by the state, ideally. That's what voting and picketing and donating is for.

Something like hyperloop is a seed to the future. It doesn't seem like much now, but it will be fruitful down the line. Just consider the facts of what traffic does to the human body. It's very stressful and degrading to health and quality of life. We spend an inordinate amount of time in traffic, it's a huge problem. Any headway in this area is greatly needed.

Solar is also very important. Moving towards renewable energy will help us break down dams. Dams disregulate fish and plants and sediment. Power outages occur, but with solar we can be more secure, and save money over the long term. Use the sun to charge your car, the earth and it's creatures win. Seriously.

Look at the percentage of US homes that have a car or a Tesla product. It’s minuscule. Tesla only started producing their own batteries to cut down on cost and to eventually sell. How many none Tesla consumer devices have Tesla batteries? None. You can buy a Tesla branded power bank for your phone with the same cells as the car, but even then it’s a promotional item not meant for profit. 

PLEASE explain how existing auto makers don’t have the ability to compete globally? It’s funny that Indian Tesla owners have to ship their cars over to the US to get mirror fixes done... damn if only Tesla had the global reach that Ford and Toyota have... It’s funny that Subaru’s eye sight is very similar to a really, really dumbed autonomous driving. Funny that VAG and Volvo came out with self driving car tech so quickly.. god it’s almost as if it’s been in the works for ages! Nissan-Renault had drive by wire as early as 2012. In theory they didn’t need a steering shaft in their cars. This is a very important step for the architecture of self driving cars. By layer the tech you make it much easier to implement things smoothly in the future. 

Also look at the big makes fingers. They have them dipped in everything to defense to house hold Items. Tesla has none of that. Tesla is a very soft and fragile thing. The fact that they can’t even meet their own production figures, have factory accidents accidents caused by the most moronic and easily fixable things and best of all... they can’t even keep their upper management. Having a strong and stabile upper management is extremely important to the success of a auto make. You don’t just need a figure head such as Elon, you need someone that actually understands things. Elon clearly doesn’t. If he did he would of put much more effort into scalable manufacturing and how the cars are designed. Aside from safety the design of Teslas are horrible. The rear suspension is of  questionable design for such a heavy car. What is usually a single piece is 2 shafts in a model S. Plenty of cars use this design, but only in the model cause they snap at mirror accidents. Iirc there was some investigation into fires caused by the rear suspension parts hitting the batteries. 

There is no actual risk or major lose or jobs to letting Tesla die. It’s on par with a washing machine makers shutting down its US factories and moving to Mexico. Tesla doesn’t have a huge dealer ship network where you have sales and mechanics spread across the county and the world. Btw Tesla’s direct sales model is a double edge sword. You’re forced to pay a premium regardless with no option to even attempt to bargain.

Both statements are true. The car had a 55 mile range while driving at a high speed on the track. It had a 200 mile range while driving on a public road.

Lets use another example. My Nissan does 60 MPG while driving around town. But It does 40 MPG on the motorway. The car was advertised saying it can do 60 MPG.

yeah fuck the diver who risked his and his colleagues' lives to save the children, if he had just ~~wasted~~ spent more time cooperating with Musk who was literally there to take selfies and gloat over how much he's helping, the whole ordeal would have been resolved much more quickly!

Look, just imagine being Unsworth - all you want is to get the kids out of there safe and sound but then there's this billionaire coming along and he's trying to tell *you* how to do your job - and all that just for PR reasons. Don't tell me you wouldn't be annoyed.

Having demand for your product is great but if you're losing money on nearly every single one after 15 years of business you're not in a good place financially.

It's largely a result of Musk's contempt for workers too. He thought he could build a fully automated factory, which turned out to be false. Now, to be profitable, his production line needs human workers for certain parts of the process; but since it was designed from the ground up to be robot only there is no room for them, hence the tent factory in the Tesla parking lot.

They've done more launches since AMOS-6 now than in the entire previous 14 years of the company's history, have one of the largest backlogs of any launch provider in the world (and yet their flightrate is limited mainly by customer availability, not their own production or pads), F9 so far this year has launched more times than any other rocket as well as as many as all other American, European, and Japanese launchers combined. Falcon 9 and Heavy are both finished with development, and are now capable of routine zero-refurb reuse instead of the experimental 2-flight use demonstrated before (which cuts their hardware costs by about 70%, but they only dropped the price about 1/6. Huge profit margin on F9 launches going forward. And FH launches are almost pure profit). Dragon 1 production has ended (just reusing previously flown capsules through the end of CRS1), Dragon 2 development is nearly finished as are the first flight units.

Also, much of their expenditures are R&D related. BFR and Starlink will both cost in the vicinity of 10 billion to develop and deploy, they're paying for nearly all of that out of their own pockets. If they hit hard times again, that development can be throttled down a bunch with no impact to ongoing operations until revenue returns. Profit (as in money the owners of the company take home) doesn't matter since they're privately held and all of their investors are either there for ideological reasons, or for very long-term non-financial gains, and pretty much all of their income goes back into development.",news,t2_1jw9f6nn,8z2i6q,e2fw9vs,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/e2fw9vs/,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/

Could it really have become an option?

Tesla has major problems in financials, probably hence your example there. They also have major issues in quality control and basic production. This was because Musk had no clue about what he was asking for in the cars.

Outside of That, everything else Musk has tried has been an utter failure. Hyperloop failed because apparently Musk doesn't know anything about mechanical engineering.

Re the sub, I suppose it depends how uneven that T junction passage is. If it's true the boys were heavily sedated, it must've taken some pushing/pulling to get them through that section. On some diagrams it looks like a sharp upside down V shape, in which case it would be useless (at least for that section).

You only know this because Elon publicized that one part of an email exchange io Twitter. I think you're being a little naive in going so far out of the way to give Musk the benefit of the doubt here.

Someone estimated the whole submarine operating cost $500,000. Maybe that's a of money to you and me, but adjusted to Elon's estimated net worth that's a whopping $8.

So Musk basically spent $8 trying to cast himself as the hero of an international rescue story and now he's defaming the people who actually rescued the kids because they had the gal to point out that Musk's *highly public* ""efforts"" were singularly unhelpful and disconnected from the reality of the situation.

You don't have to believe Musk was super calculated here to accept that his intentions were bad.

No. The point is he literally acted like he was a major supporter of climate change. He talked about how we needed to do something about it. It's not even that he doesn't believe in it, it's that he claimed he did for PR then donated to the Republicans. It's the equivalent of finding out one of those anti-gay preachers hires male prostitutes. 

> There is lots of debate still to be had on the climate change issue

No, there literally isn't. At least not on if it exists and if it's being done by man. This is a very, very American and invented thing. It is accepted by every major scientific body in the world. The only major political party who refused to acknowledge it in *the world* is the American Republican party. The idea that climate change is still contentious is an American invention. The only thing we're not in agreement about is *how* fucked we are and the best way to avoid it. No, you can't ever be ""sure"", but the theory of gravity is also just a theory. There's nothing we can do to prove that the next time you drop your wallet it won't fly up to the ceiling. That's how reality works.

And in doing so we should be critical of what is truly important, and not get clouded with emotion where it doesn't truly have much of an impact.

Idolization is indeed a terrible thing and is in line with what I'm saying. Hatred can be destructive in the exact same way as idolization. It's oh so easy to discredit everything some one has ever done just because you don't personally like them. Everyone suddenly wants Musk gone because he's an asshole,but how will this truly benefit society? I'm convinced his companies succeeding will be a huge benefit.

that is the polarized thought process I'm complaining about. You shouldn't just judge people by what they say, but by how they affect society as a whole. I'm not sure why I mentioned Trump, since his statements as a political leader obviously have a significant effect on society, and are in fact proven to be dangerous and destructive. 
But the personal opinions of a tech entrepreneur don't really affect anything other then his companies' internal workings and external image, since what his companies *do* is in the end what will affect the world.

Him being a massive cunt right now doesn't discredit his past achievements or the fact that he DOES work a shit ton.

Honestly I put Musk and Jobs in two different categories. Musk, certainly innovative and a man of high intellect, in my opinion, has yet to impact society as a whole. But his story isn’t over.

As for Steve Jobs. We can all disagree on his character, but there is not doubt the impact he has had on society in the past 30 or so years. But addressing your point about him not needing to be an asshole, I disagree. But I won’t argue with you on that, seeing that I think it’s valid to hold that opinion.

Apparently I'm going to have to really break this down for you. The political party you like isn't the only one with people who care about the environment. People who disagree with your methods do not necessarily disagree with your goals. Keep that in mind as you examine every single policy difference between competing political movements.

In order to prove that Elon's words were libelous, you have to prove what he said was false, that it was reckless, and that tangible harm or damages were caused. Depending on who the person is, you could also be required to prove actual malice as well, which can be damn near impossible.

Manufacturing isn't a big thing with this, if you have the kit as he did. Take a look at it for god's sake. Cut the tube to length, weld on the flange. On a 15"" diameter tube this will take a welder a few hours.

Drill out air hose connection pilot holes in the end cap, and affix the air hose connection for inlet, and a one way vent for breathing out. Use a demand valve on the inlet to ensure that the pressure is maintained at just above ambient, so that the person inside can continue to breath as normal, with out breaths going out.

Fit o-ring to the end, and use hand bolts to close the end onto the vessel.

Perhaps you're concerned that there will be compression issues from going up and down in the water. That's valid. If you're squeezed into a tube with no control over your depth, holding your nose to equalise might be tricky. Now we have to be able to ensure that the pressure in the tank remains relatively constant even though the pressure outside is varying with depth. Now you're into the territory of maybe needing to fit a rebreather and other complex controls. Or you work out the maximum depth they're going to get to, and pressurise them up to that point before setting off. This would waste a lot of air though.

Alternatively, you could sedate the boys to reduce their respiration and avoid panic attacks, and guide them through the tunnel being able to manhandle them through tight spaces, flexing them to fit.

Not necessarily. Consider the line of reasoning for the thread you're in:

>he's a billionaire business owner and you have to bribe politicians in America. This isn't new.

>its important to keep those channels open in case you need something of them

According to the argument, the system is rigged in a way that sometimes you have to pay your rivals in order to defeat them.

This is implying that in order for Musk to (further) pave the way for clean energy in respect to combatting premature climate change, he must play ball with his opposition. Playing ball can mean donating to them in order to receive benefits that would potentially bite them in the ass, in the end.

I'm not arguing one way or the other--I don't understand the system well enough to say this is true or inaccurate. And even if it's true, I don't know enough about the nuances of particularly Musk's actions and if they're truly in line with taking advantage of the system in order to ultimately progress the system.

But I'm just saying that your comment seems to be missing this fundamental aspect of this thread's argument. Because you're saying ""if he donates/supports them in any way, therefore he is inherently dismissing his alleged interest/values in fighting against climate change/clean energy."" I find that reasoning to be problematic in respect to the argument.

You're not addressing whether or not Musk may be required to financially support the GOP in order to ultimately pull the rug out from under them.

All they said was literally ""if you can prove that's libel.""

Are you disagreeing that in order for Musk to be charged with libel, it has to be proved in a court?

Libel isn't as easy to be charged with as you're implying. You have to prove something is a lie then prove your intention was to lie. That can be hard to do when the only basis you have is someone remarking with ""Sorry pedo guy,...""

I'm not saying a libel case can't be won here. It certainly might, because if Musk is wrong, then it definitely seems to be libel.

I'm just saying that you're putting *a lot of different claims* into riva_nation05's mouth when all they implied was, ""he'll face a lawsuit if it's proved to be libel.""

The ""proving"" process can be convoluted.

Since this is my first mention of Musk in 5 years or so on Reddit, it would appear you are wrong.

> The way that is written defiantly conveys he was the sole person responsible for the rescues 

Only if you an idiot and think one man can carry multiple tons of equipment through narrow, underwater tunnels himself in a few days, and then clone himself so that each child had 2 dive buddies. He was the man responsible for many aspects of the rescue from start to finish.

> Probably his employees since he grew the companies they work at big enough to give them a career 

Should have read the link about the shitty conditions at his factories before typing that.

> Elon is Notorious for working consistent 100 hour weeks.

As I said, who cares.

> I don’t get why you brought up what he pays his workers when I said “he works really hard”.

Because he pays shit wages in shit working conditions to the people creating his wealth while he lives the high life, and he is not responsible for all their technology. Fanyboys really do think he is Iron Man. 

> I’m SUPER confused where you pulled this random hypothetical situation from

Well this entire weird diversion started out with you trying to use his supposed work ethic as an excuse to call someone a pedo. And here we are.

Musk has got nothing on a mom working 3 jobs to feed her kids either. That is hard work, not designing useless toys to get some PR out of a possible tragedy.

> You are just trying to insult the man and belittle his accomplishments

Nope, just stating facts. Read the link about working conditions.

> I defiantly never said this.

*When some one with that type of worth ethic ... *

You were attempting to use work ethic as an excuse for his behaviour.

> The man insulted him ON TV to thousands of people.

No he didn't, he gave an accurate assessment (shared by the whole rescue team) that Musk was a distraction looking for PR with a completely useless device. He then suggested a use for the device :)

> Just because he helped rescue those boys does not make him invulnerable to a counter insult 

As above, he gave an accurate assessment and Musk then called him a pedo with zero evidence. That is not an insult, that is an incredibly serious allegation of criminal behaviour.

Btw, you keep mentioning him working 100 hours a week. Why do you think this is a good thing and testament to good character?

> If people trying to help in a crisis situation is a bad thing and completely useless I have no faith in humanity

He wasn't trying to help, he was trying to get free PR. He did literally nothing to help. Not a damn thing. Meanwhile, the guy he called a pedo spent weeks saving those kids.

> Plus he flew out to the cave, meet with experts in different fields. A lot more then “a few days of work”

Again, more useless bullshit and he didn't meet with the experts. For example he didn't meet Unsworth - the actual expert on this cave. He flew in with a fucking toy, took some pictures and then left on the orders of the rescue team.

> Ok in what world during a PR STUNT WOULD A PERSON USE AN INSULT AGAINST A DIVER WHO HELPED

Because the diver was telling the world that is was a PR stunt and in no way an attempt to help the kids. That blows up Musk's PR narrative and he couldn't handle it.

>  It can’t possibly be a PR stunt since he is so sincere and obviously cares enough to get mad about it.

He got mad that his bullshit was exposed by an expert and one of the rescue leads.

> If it was a PR stunt by a corporate team this post wouldn’t be here right now because they wouldn’t have said anything.

What? Are you trying to say that Musk is bound by some kind of corporate code on Twitter? Fucking lol. Just this week he had to apologise for his behaviour on the platform. In fact, one of the major shareholders has said they will be speaking to Musk about his behaviour on Monday as he has a long history of this.

> I guess people like other people who try and make the world a better place. 

That is not the definition of a cult. We are referring to the hero worship and blind defence of Musk, despite the evidence, has the hallmarks of cultism. Like this massive post of yours defending him calling Unsworth a pedo.

> you try to hide the fact that he insulted the man on tv by changing the subject to his accomplishment

He did not insult him, he rightly pointed out that using the potential deaths of 12 children as a PR stunt is fucking obscene.

> Yes bill gates sets up charities and donates but when do you see him jump in with engineers and scientists to help in really specific situations. 

Oh god you must be young. Gates did all that decades ago, and I am no fan of that period of his life. The guy lived code and was hands on with all parts of the OS and other software back in the day. He also didn't use rescues for some PR, if you are implying that sending a useless tube to Thailand somehow counts. 

Since then, he has helped humanity far more than Musk ever has or will.

> Once again you change the subject from the fact the diver insulted him to cry “he was trying to get pr” 

The guy did not insult him, he correctly stated that he was trying to get PR. That is the very basis of what Unsworth was saying in the interview. Musk then took that as an insult and called him a pedo. You then spend paragraphs defending Musk. 

> Actually I didn’t even know his name until you said it,

Exactly, yet you are here slobbering all over the dick of a man who did jack shit and called him a pedo. 

> The diver started all this.

No, Musk did by turning up with a fucking useless sub in the name of PR. 

> He could’ve taken the credit

He didn't want the credit. Not everyone is obsessed with fame, wealth and 100 hour working weeks like you.

> he went on TV to smear Elon’s name

Hah, you on first name terms with your good buddy eh. Nope, not a cult at all lol.

Musk smeared his own name by seeking PR in a tragedy and then doubling down on calling someone actually involved a pedo. He deserved the contempt shown to him.

> You actually typed that like unsworth didn’t do or say anything and Elon insulted him out of no where.

That's because he did insult him out of nowhere. Unsworth gave the accurate assessment of Musk's contributions and then Musk called him a pedo. One of those things is not like the others.

>  Elon sent a tweet the diver was on TV broadcasting to thousands 

To thousands yeah. And Musk has 22 million Twitter fanboys just like you. 

So the truth went to thousands and Musk's lie was broadcast to tens of millions and then amplified by people like you.

> All in all I think Elon’s genuine 

Genuine what? What the fuck does that even mean. 

> you cant actually think this is a PR stunt since so many people are hating him right now.

Jesus Christ are you 12 or something? You think PR can't go tits up when it is exposed as fake or poorly framed? Really?

> the diver insulted him first, he deserves some back. 

He did not insult him. He gave an accurate assessment of Musk's contribution and tasteless PR stunt. Regardless, you think calling him a pedo is an appropriate response?

> I don’t know how we got to insulting each other

Your stance in this thread leaves us with only that conclusion.

Probably. There were cavers and cave divers there, which are not the same thing. Cave diving is extremely specialised and extremely dangerous.

It is a chance to promote the use of one of my favourite words though - spelunker. That is someone who does not dive, but hangs around caves.

There are, though. However, it's a battle of semantics, and it depends on how you define a ""selfless act"". Buddhist monks have immolated themselves to death as a form of political protest.

I'm still not sure that even you knew it was a phrase that one could find a previous use of, which isn't to say it might not be rather familiar to some.

Either way, drop the sarcasm.  If you meet requests for verification with snark you look like an asshole.  Especially since you've only shown (a single decade old) use of the phrase, and not verified the etymology you've claimed.

The relevant query gives [27 results](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22bet+a+signed+dollar%22+-elon+-musk&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8)\* so it's perfectly reasonable to be skeptical, and it gives [no results](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=bet+a+signed+dollar&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=) in the Ngram Viewer.

Calling Thai's ""pedo people"" isn't the way of course, but something has gotta give in support of eliminating abusive culture. It's not okay if something unethical happens elsewhere just because it's elsewhere--there's a certain pressure we ought to feel in regard to supporting ethical progress wherever it's needed.

I also don't have any problem with giving the benefit of the doubt to people in theory, but Elon's past actions and the absurdity of this latest stunt have made it impossible for me to do that when considering the full context.

This certainly isn't the first time Elon has revealed himself to be [a stubborn, petty idiot](https://www.indy100.com/article/elon-musk-nanotechnology-scientists-roasting-twitter-tesla-spacex-8370466) and [all around messy bitch](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/995065228403458048?lang=en) To the extent that even [the most crony media is forced to admit that its negatively affecting his business life.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hershshefrin/2018/05/06/elon-musks-tesla-tantrum) The [safety records of his factories](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-says-his-factory-is-safe-but-tesla-left-workers-injuries-off-the-books\_us\_5b082260e4b0568a880aea8d) that [he personally sabotages to increase production](http://fortune.com/2018/07/04/tesla-brake-and-roll-test-skip-stock) definitely isn't a good mark on his character, much more so than his twitter ramblings.

So assuming that he went into the submarine venture in good faith is already quite a stretch. He's got a history of some pretty public narcissism and ridiculous ideas that professionals never took seriously (hundreds of miles of massive pressurized tubing, anyone?)  And that certainly isn't helped when he [spends hours showboating his newest venture to the same twitter fanboys](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1016000972730978304?lang=en) while clearly never actually being in contact with the actual rescue operation, which was massive and very professional. [Surely if he had, then the head of the 1,000+ person operation would've informed him that the design wasn't actually useful *before* he dropped it off outside the cave.](https://www.theguardian.com/news/live/2018/jul/10/thai-cave-rescue-third-mission-planned-to-bring-out-remaining-boys-and-coach-live-updates?page=with:block-5b446023e4b04dbcfcbddeec#block-5b446023e4b04dbcfcbddeec) And there is the local caving expert who also weighed in, and is the subject of this thread.

tl;dr: I think Elon Musk has demonstrated he's a shit-head through this and previously, and is well beyond deserving the benefit of the doubt. Also please read my absurd sources from the worst ""news"" sites, because those are the only places that would actually bother reporting on petty twitter drama.

I can't read minds.

They can absolutely refer to articles, links, books, videos, instead of explaining themselves, but ""Elon Musk's just fucking awful, Google it"" is not a coherent way to start a discussion.

So you dropped a few hints up there and now I *can* Google that, instead of just guessing blindly whatever anyone meant.

And I can find the coverage explaining that:

> Unnamed employees told Businessweek they were asked to walk through raw sewage that had spilled on the factory floor in order to keep the line going.

This doesn't quite have the same ring to it as ""being forced to walk through sewage"". It was *an accident* and the ""sewage"" in question was shallow and on a part of the factory floor. Very unpleasant, but shit like this happens (pun not intended). 

I've been forced to walk through sewage in my building's basement after unprecedented rainfalls flooded the streets in my region few weeks ago and we needed to get that water out pronto. Who do I blame? Do I get to hate someone?

Without context it sounds like Elon Musk directed his employees to regularly go through underground sewage for no reason. Elon's just crazy, I guess!

From the same article we can also read Elon Musk slept for days on the floor of the same factory to keep the line going, and to show empathy to the hardship of his employees. Of course you didn't mention that, you're selective. You're biased.

Nor you mention many of Tesla's employees that contradict the reports that Tesla doesn't care about safety or that it's more dangerous than any other factory. 

As for the ""Elon doesn't like yellow so there are no safety markers"", that's often repeated because it's short, it's outrageous, and makes a nice meme. Of course **it's not even true**:

> Tesla denies this and sent Reveal photos of “rails and posts” painted yellow in the factory.

The ""controversy"" stemmed from Tesla painting some pathways white instead of yellow. Needless to say if you make everything yellow, claiming yellow is a ""marker that improves safety"" becomes a non-sequitur. The pathways are clearly visible in photos.

And... hard data. Despite unsourced statements that Tesla ""has way more injuries than other factories"", data [clearly says otherwise](https://www.tesla.com/blog/becoming-safest-car-factory-world). **Tesla has half the rate of injuries compared to industry average**.

So... here. Something concrete to talk about. Happy? No. You'll probably downvote and reply with insults or not reply. Because that's the real point here. It's not facts, it's not logic, it's not a rational debate. It's ""hate Elon or I hate you"".

The only reason I made my comment in the first place is because saying that Tesla sued them for a bad review seems worse than it is when you don’t add any context. I also think it’s disingenuous to dismiss top gear of any wrong doing because they’re a comedy show. It has legitimate reviews mixed in with comedy segments. Scripting a car breaking down during a track review is much different than having it break down during a head to head road trip challenge or something similar. People have high regards for their actual car reviews they do. ,news,t2_1jw9f6nn,8z2i6q,e2g7jmq,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/e2g7jmq/,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/

something can be considered slanderous without qualifying as a legal tort. Further, legal claims for tort cases in the UK have a limitation period, which the Tesla suit was outside of. 

""The judge pointed out that two features of the case gave rise to issues of causation (paragraph [7]). The first was the fact that most of those who had viewed the programme had done so before 30th March 2010 and therefore outside the limitation period; the second was that Tesla admitted that the range of the Roadster on the test track was about 55 miles and that if it ran out of charge it took several hours to charge it up again. Moreover, as he later pointed out, in relation to the claim for malicious falsehood, the question of causation was further complicated by the inclusion in the programme of a number of statements favourable to the Roadster as well as statements that were unfavourable but accepted to be true.""

I'm not trying to say that it wasn't unreasonable for the British courts to deny Tesla damages in this ruling, but I am saying your representation of the case from your original comment was inaccurate. You should also look into how Tort claims in the UK also have considerations for if the company has a reputation in the UK at the time of the potentially slanderous remarks were made.

Your link doesn't say that Stanton said that. It says that Stanton's 'spokesman' said the cave ended up being too narrow after the rescue was done. It doesn't say anything about this being relayed to Musk.

> All that Elon Musk wanted was to be the hero who saves the day. 

Pure hyperbole, and you could attribute the same motive to Unsworth with just as much validity. Maybe try sticking to the facts. 

>yeah fuck the diver who risked his and his colleagues' lives to save the children...

He said that cave was like his second home. I can't imagine he was too uncomfortable with it. 

> ...if he had just ~~wasted~~ spent more time cooperating with Musk... 

How long does it take to say, ""I don't think a rigid capsule will work on account of the bends in the cave?""

>...who was literally there to take selfies and gloat over how much he's helping...

Did he take selfies? Could you link them please? The rest of this is pure hyperbole and you assigning motive as though you can read minds, but that's a claim you could back up.

If tomorrow he announced that he would be the first person on Mars, you'd better believe the news would cover it whether or not he ""wants"" them to. If you want to do something under the radar, you contact people directly, you reach out quietly. And even then, maybe word gets out and you can't do anything about it. But the guy went on twitter and made a comment about him helping. He has 22 million twitter followers. If he tweets about his intentions, I don't buy the ""he didn't ask for the news coverage"" argument. If it had absolutely nothing to do with PR, he wouldn't have gone to a public forum and made a statement that tens of millions of people would be be able to see. For the record, I do believe that he actually wanted to help out. But I can't ignore the self-serving manner in which he went about it.

Also, for a good while, things I read made it sound as though the sub was going to be non-rigid, made of some sort of thick rubber of similar, which actually sounds like it could work.

4558,JazzyMcSpazzy,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/thai-cave-rescue-elon-musk-british-diver-vern-unsworth-twitter-pedo-a8448366.html,"1. First of all, no, Tesla is a very profitable company because of the growing electric car market, which makes a more efficient way of travel.

2. Yes, they are, they are working on a project called the BFR that is supposed to be able to carry 200 metric tons and be reusable which is a huuuge feat when it comes to rocket technology.

3. Actually no, he gets a lot of his money from Spacex and Tesla which were built successfully after taking a massive business risk by dividing most of his profits towards the two companies in order to make them gain interest and eventually make more profit.

4. Incorrect, because there are two automobile companies that haven’t gone bankrupt or even close to it and they are Tesla and Ford. He does know exactly what he wants in the cars. He wants an affordable, environmentally friendly electric car. He wants to move this entire world to a place that has the freedom to be able to make everything accessible and renewable. Which it seems he’s already doing so considering he is making a good impact on the community since it’s quite obvious how well the Tesla sales are doing.

5. Next, the hyper loop hasn’t fallen through yet. They’re still developing concepts and working on a way to make it save to travel in tunnels where the terrain is flat enough to support that kind of speed and still be seamless and finding ways to keep the tubes safe and secure so that in case of an emergency, they are able to pull through or have an escape route. 

6. Actually, they’re still working on it. The project started fairly recently and it’s good progress to say that they’ve been dug a tunnel. There’s a lot of construction going around in many urban and suburban parts of the world and with that construction there are delays such as road-ways, buildings, and other structures but they’ve managed to make a decent size hole with their project and that’s good enough to say that they’re still making an effort on things for the greater good of us. Seamless transportation is upon us and he is the man who can make that happen. Give the dude a chance, and watch him for a while. I guarantee he’s not trying to hurt you, he’s just trying to make things easier for us and is that really such a bad fucking thing?

7. There are things called batteries that can charge up and store energy.  The solar energy doesn’t just go from the panel straight to the rocket without excess energy. You can have extra power to an object, and they help you use that energy for the rocket. It doesn’t have to charge while running and while yes that would be a good idea, I’m sure that the entire crew of mechanical engineers and scientists have already thought of it. It’s not just him thinking about these things. 

8. SpaceX has gone a long way in the 16 years it’s been running. They’re developing ways to go to Mars and showing the media everything it’s doing. They have already developed ways of colonization on mars and are planning to send people there in the next couple years. You can search on NASA’s website and you’ll find almost nothing on the colonization of mars, which doesn’t stand well for a company that has been up and running for 60 years. I think that’s quite surpassing what NASA has been working on for years.

9. There is nothing wrong with Tesla. It’s is very financially stable and is working like crazy! Tesla is constantly making sales and is more healthy for the environment than a lot of companies out there. They’re not even close to bankruptcy and aren’t going to be there anytime soon. Their stocks are at $323 and rising quite well. They’re making a fine amount of money and will be in business for many years to come. And, no he probably won’t consider stopping these projects for a very long time. There is nothing wrong with the hyperloop or the car tunnels, they are just trying to create an easier way of transportation for the world to use, and is that really such a bad thing? He’s just trying to make the world a more efficient place. Saving time one step at a time and that’s all we’re really trying to do today. So I think that Elon is doing just fine with the work he’s done. He’s making big steps in this world and I really don’t see why anybody is against him. There’s nothing bad he’s done for the community and i really don’t see him changing that. Also, he was calling him Pedo guy because the coach was telling him to make sexual acts with his tunnel, so if anything, I think the media is trying to screw him over for many things even though he has nothing to be criticized for. They’re just saying this because it brings attention to their content. They know people will click on it because “Oh, this massive multi-billionaire just called this dude a pedo, better fuckin get this!” It’s just news clickbait. He had a full right to defend him self from this. I’m pretty sure that if someone were to insult you then you might want to say something back and don’t be one of those people who would say “no, I wouldn’t because it’s wrong to say something back because i think saying nothing is better than saying anything at all” and while yes it’s kind of true, you know you would say something back because you’re not going to take it. All I’m saying is that there is no reason to call out what Elon said because he was just trying to do the right thing and help innocent people and then he gets called out on it. Like what kind of monster do you have to be to say bad things about people who are trying to help you. Like, what the fuck? Elon is not trying to hurt anyone and the media is just trying to squeeze every little bit of attention out of current events to get people drawn in.

(Talking about sociopathic CEOs in general)
It's game theory. If you're an unethical asshole you're willing to do things that are immoral for gains that more ethical people wouldn't. They have an advantage due to that, and the result is a bunch of people with power that really shouldn't have it. People who don't care about other people's well-being shouldn't have power over them, it's a recipe for disaster. It's a mathematical and statistical inevitability right now though and it's fucking up society in general. Unethical and damaging behavior shouldn't be rewarded.

Can confirm with flying colors. If you're doing a long commute/drive/roadtrip and you aren't prepared with music/podcasts/audiobooks that you're interested in listening to, then you're driving wrong.

At least, in my opinion, of course. Perhaps YMMV. But I think most people underestimate how pleasant these activities are for turning commutes from *horrific and dreaded and life draining experiences* into *something you look forward to and enjoy.*

Really tough to come to a solution, especially because Russia and China will absolutely not engage fairly with the agreement. They will cheat, and cheat as hard as they can manage add national government, so there is no point in trying to get them to, they will say they want to join a coalition, but they won't be earnest partners.

Sorry, it's my bias showing. Economic independence is an important part of preventing abuse, physical or emotional, in a romantic relationship. 

Before my family moved to Canada, my mom was the breadwinner, being a programmer, and my dad was a factory worker (with an engineering degree), due to lack of connections. Things were bad. Mom was pretty physical in fights.

Dad studied English to prepare for emigration, though, and my mom didn't, instead focusing on my dad.

So obviously when we moved to Canada, roles were switched. Things were still bad. As far as I know, dad was never physical, but he did say stuff like, ""If you don't like this family, then leave"", which is obviously impossible since my mom never really got back into an office position.

You can't take money from one company and use it to prop up another. Musk can use his own money and can entice investors, but drawing money from one company to another is just BEGGING for legal trouble. 

> I'm sure there's investors who would be interested in a chunk to tesla

Those investors are already bought into Tesla. It's a publically traded company. Tesla has been overvalued on the market for years now and the only investors rich enough to try and save it are also smart enough not to. The Model 3 is Tesla's hail Mary. If it doesn't succeed in a massive way, they'll never have the cash flow to cover their debts. And considering it is both far behind schedule and likely to only be profitable at all at its highest price point, anything other than a flop seems unlikely. 

I half wonder if the reason Musk has been acting out and in PR overdrive is because Tesla's position is even worse than all that. He has strung investors along on missed deadlines for years now; News that pushes things back even a few more months would cause trust in him to crater.

> Society can only get that much liberal until it becomes its own problem

Citation needed. Also, the elements of the established order tend to resist upsets to the order, but that’s a side point. Let’s continue.

> as the younger generation become more and more right leaning.

Again, citation needed.

> I guess that's what happens when for example gay pride in the eyes of the left is having naked men on the street, as that has anything to do with being ""gay"" for some stretch of imagination

That literally is part of the point of Pride. You do realise Pride started as a riot, right? It’s meant to be transgressive, to go against societal norms. Besides, Pride isn’t for you. It’s not for people to see what LGBT people are, it’s for LGBT people to celebrate what they are. Also I’m concerned by you quote marks around the word ‘gay’. Do you think homosexuality isn’t a thing, or that a lot of the people doing it in Pride aren’t actually gay, or some other reason?

> people that call themselves anti-fascists act like literally fascists

Ok, so to start its, Antifa, the organisation you seem to be referencing here, isn’t exactly a contiguous movement. It’s even less of a monolith than most movements. It’s essentially a load of people calling themselves antifa but not really necessarily working with each other at all. So just because some members are arseholes doesn’t mean every member is out there sending death threats to white nationalists. But even so:

Fascism according to the Merriam Webster dictionary:

1 : a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition

2 : a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control

Can you explain to me how antifa is doing anything except some members engaging in “forcible suppression of opposition”? Seriously, I’d be intrigued to find out how antifa are engaging in nationalism, dictatorship, etc.

Then I’d like to point you to the philosophy of Karl Popper. He proposed something called the paradox of tolerance, which postis that due to intolerance’s (in this case fascism and white nationalism) tendency to stamp out tolerance by its very nature, a tolerant tpsociety that tolerates intolerance is liable to lose all its tolerance. As such, he argues, a truly tolerant society can not tolerate intolerance, however paradoxical that may sound.

> calling nazis and racist slurs anyone with a slightly different view

The overuse of the word ‘nazi’ is a problem in both the left and the righ,tvthough admittedly more on the left. At the same time, if you’re pushed to white nationalism because you were called a Nazi by some moron, I fear you were a little closer already than you might want to believe. Those people need to take some responsibility for their own decisions.

I’d also like a example for that ‘racist slur’ thing, btw. I haven’t come across that in people ostensibly against racism.

> burning and loitering

That’s more an arsehole thing than a left or antifa thing. But nice try trying to put that on the left. Stupid, but you know, I admire the attempt.

> parents deciding the gender of a toddler

Feel free to provide a source for that as well. Huh, it’s surprising how often these sorts of wild rants are entirely lacking in actual back up to their claims. Also, isn’t that what happens by default? Children are assumed to be their birthed gender, which is largely fine, tbh, unless the parents and wider society insist the child must be that gender and follow its stereotypes, which is where confusion and trauma can arise in transgender children.

> mentally sick people being put on pedestals

You know it’s a funny thing, but I can’t identify which ‘mentally wick’ people you’re referring to here. Based on the rest of what you’ve said, I’m guessing trans people are by your definition ‘mentally sick’, but maybe I’m giving you too little credit. Just to spell it out: mentally ill people are not put on a pedestal, it’s just they are becoming more recognised and allowed for in wider society, which looks like they’re getting put on a pedestal because they’re being brought up to your level of privilege, which requires aid be given to make up for their deficiencies.

> The majority of normal people are slowly getting sick of tolerating the intolerant

Looking at this, I’m concerned and mildly confused. Do you think the far left is intolerant? That’s a bit foolish. Also, who are the ‘normal’ people here? This is part of the problem, cis white men or whatever your definition of ‘normal’ should not be the default, because that partially erases and discredits the experiences of those you consider ‘abnormal’.

> The fact that strongly leftist European countries have literally far-right parties with close to 15-20% of votes when even 5 years ago it was under 1%(!!!) should be a strong alarm for everyone.

Again, citation needed, though in this case I believe it’s more or less accurate. The problem has a lot of causes, not least of which is the blatant lies from the far right to make the disenfranchised feel like they had something to work towards.

Finally, a bit of perspective. A lot of young people nowadays are feeling disencfrnachised with the emocraticcsystem in which they live. They feel like their society has ignored them in favour of those they have a vague sense of ‘not being normal’. Young cis white guys have, in the West, been feeling like thy don’t have a group, somehingvto feel proud about. Everyone else does - LGBT people have Pride, black people, Asian people, latinas are allowed to have pride in their racial background, it seems to them that women are constantly getting preferential treatment over them. They feel like cis white guys aren’t allowed to be proud of what they are. Then someone comes along who says “you can celebrate your whiteness, your maleness, your begin cis. You’re normal, they’re not.” And they feel like they have a voice. The far right picks up the disenfranchised, all these youths who feel put upon because they cannot appreciate the vast gulf in privilege between them and those they are vaguely jealous of. They cannot understand that they are already considered the default, the ones much of western society is optimised for. Because of this, they get pulled in by the nice-sounding lies of the far right. Once in, it becomes an echo chamber. People are worse when surrounded by worse people. This tribalism pulls them further down.

This is part of what has caused this phenomenon of so many youths turning to the far right. They feel like the left is pushing them away, sure, but in reality the left is just trying to begin all the others up to their level of privilege, get society to no longer treat them as the default.",news,t2_1jw9f6nn,8z2i6q,e2i177e,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/e2i177e/,/r/news/comments/8z2i6q/elon_musk_calls_british_diver_who_helped_rescue/

AFAIK, he didn't start making the pod until he had dimensions that would be viable. How did he get the wrong dimensions? And if he got the wrong dimensions, what's wrong about him making it if he thought they were the proper dimensions?

Yes it's exploiting in some sense, but it's perfectly legal and ethical.

To get it into perspective: imagine starting a business, you are allowed to make contracts that say someone has to do X for 40 hours with minimum pay. Now you CANNOT force anyone into signing it, and even if someone signs it he can back out by just quitting the job. 

So now imagine that for every contract you make there is 100 people fully willing to sign it, and to work hard 40 hours a week for minimum pay.

Would you have any incentive to higher the wages for your workforce? Even more so: wouldn't you be anti-competetive if you'd do so? The joke is, you start caring too much about your employees, they will get lazy and your costs will rise through the roof and your competitors will simply kill your company.

That's why feelings and business don't mix, you make your employees work as hard as possible, keep them happy enough to not revolt or quit and re-invest all of your profit to make the company grow and to spread your risks (in the process this makes you personally also richer as the company's assets are on your name).

The whole last week made me lose faith in humanity a little. Hating on a guy who tries to help because he has a lot of fans. That's all there was to it. Had Musk no fans nobody had said anything. Like that the press probably asked everyone about Musk's submarine so they all naturally got pissed. However, that was not Musk's fault. That was the  clickbait press - as usual.
