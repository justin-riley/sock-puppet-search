There's this thing, that people mix up the power to alter the economy with the power to have a lot of money. Musk is admirable, a fish with a lot of power who can swim against current easily, but no matter how hard he swims, the current will still go whatever way it wants to.

Musk has the power to keep the Gigafactory 2 going, and weather it through both its incompetence and the current economic environment (we'll see what happens if a crisis hits).

Musk promised the sun and the moon with SolarCity, but:

1. They never had the technology to back it up. (Several examples given, including SolarRoof.)
2. Their experimental business model of running up huge amounts of debt in order to finance solar panels that consumers pay on an installment plan didn't actually scale (in large part because they never had the technology to meet their cost projections).

In order to bail the company out, Musk not only put himself in a lot of personal debt, but also used his other companies to buy SolarCity bonds. When this became disastrously untenable, Musk pushed for Tesla to buy SolarCity.

Thus, instead of being able to walk away from SolarCity's failure, Musk has basically put his entire business empire at jeopardy.",tech,t2_lp7uy,cvhvsq,ey53zh4,/r/tech/comments/cvhvsq/hes_full_of_shit_how_elon_musk_gambled_tesla_to/ey53zh4/,/r/tech/comments/cvhvsq/hes_full_of_shit_how_elon_musk_gambled_tesla_to/

Musk tried to prop up Solar City but couldn't by himself, so he convinced Tesla to buy the company (only convinced them after holding that big press conference showing off the houses and talking about climate change, and apparently the tech never existed).

 Now a large chunk of Tesla's debt is actually Solar City's debt, and they're in trouble and will owe New York state a ton of money for a failure to create jobs. Not to mention a Walmart lawsuit for Solar City solar panels catching fire on 7 Walmart stores.

58,ryapeter,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/08/how-elon-musk-gambled-tesla-to-save-solarcity,"I‚Äôm pro for positive changes. 
Solar with battery storage. Electric vehicle (not just personal vehicle).

But what I don‚Äôt like is his hyperbole.

1. As the article said his solar city when announced promised a lot. So I google maybe theres new thing with solar generation. None. Wait for few years not much change. Last month theres article about improving efficiency to 80% and it looks promising so maybe just maybe. FYI general panel roughly about 20% in great condition and location.

2. The battery. So much words come out so many article. It is 18650 with shiny case. When apple do this in early 2000 it‚Äôs great. Now not so much. I‚Äôd say we are just waiting for timing. Rather then improving battery there‚Äôs so many improvement in charging speed (with unwanted side effect but SPEEEEEED!!!)

3. Hyperloop. I‚Äôm not sure how this can improve. Joining traffic at high speed you need great driver (idiotsincars calling). If he decide to use elevator that will slow it further or safety. If you pay attention what slow traffic down it‚Äôs the ramp and toll gate. You put 1000 cars go thru and it will pile up (Thats why mass transport works for longer distances). Some country have this overhead automated system that can charge the toll even if you go over 100mph. Better solution already exist. I know I will be hated to support working public transport.

SpaceX so far so good. The hyperbole over there kinda works.

We have many technologies that can improve life significantly. But creating new one always better headline.

Take Apple for example. They are hated for stealing tech. Yes you can say they steal, but what they did is improving on that to make product that we actually can can use with ease. They are not the first one to see mouse, but they are the one with vision of gui for public. Not the first touch screen phone, i experienced early touch screen and people who know that junk (ericsson no sony yet. Palm. And that one sideways blackberry) will agree with me.

Proper implementation is as important as finding new technology.

When the product enjoyable to use there will be more users. More sales reaching economy of scale.

I would prefer for him to do less hyperbole he have capacity to reach people just by making stuff properly",tech,t2_lp7uy,cvhvsq,ey4mb6y,/r/tech/comments/cvhvsq/hes_full_of_shit_how_elon_musk_gambled_tesla_to/ey4mb6y/,/r/tech/comments/cvhvsq/hes_full_of_shit_how_elon_musk_gambled_tesla_to/

If  Tesla is getting (let‚Äôs pretend here) $43k/model 3, and then the purchaser get $8k in credits to drop the price to $35k, Tesla is still collecting $43k.

If I never want a Tesla, I will still have to help fund Tesla through those subsidies. 

I have 0 problem with a company generating revenue from a benevolent agenda. I do take issue with false promises to governments, shareholders, and the public. Collecting $750 million in subsidies to bring a company back from potential peril (as was the case with solar city) is fine if you try to deliver, but there were items on the periphery of that deal that made it difficult to reconcile, which is what spawned many law suits. There are also Tesla shareholders who believed in Musk‚Äôs vision who are losing money hand-over-fist because he doesn‚Äôt deliver on his promises.

The problem is, as the article outlines, Tesla took 750m from a state government to do something. They didn‚Äôt do it. Tesla has not been a profitable company. The government giving them $750m, and $8k/car is a problem. They cannot stand on their own. 

I realize that the amounts have gone down. They get less per car in subsidies now, but for the vast majority of the time, until the end of last year, they got the credits to use as a sales tactic.

And the initial issue wasn‚Äôt with the EB credit, it was with tax money given to Tesla as part of a buyout of solar city. The tax subsidies for Tesla (I was saying if the car cost 43k and you get 8k back) are just a part of it. No company should get that. The problem is, as the article outlines, Tesla took 750m from a state government to do something. They didn‚Äôt do it. Tesla has not been a profitable company. The government giving them $750m, and $8k/car is a problem. They cannot stand on their own.

What exactly is it they didn't do that you think should have happened?

>I realize that the amounts have gone down. They get less per car in subsidies now, but for the vast majority of the time, until the end of last year, they got the credits to use as a sales tactic. It was on their website, in fact, when you priced the car. I know this because I used the website, when I originally looked at buying a Tesla.

Literally every single car company selling an EV does the same thing. Like I said, it's not a Tesla subsidy, that would be illegal. It's an EV subsidy - the same thing happens when you buy a Nissan Leaf.

>And don‚Äôt bring the president into it, he has had nothing to do with it. What he does or doesn‚Äôt do isn‚Äôt a part of this article and has nothing to do with what currently is the issue or what was the issue when the government of New York gave this money to Tesla.

So before it was about wasting tax dollars, but now it's about only targeting Tesla?

I mean your president just approved billions upon billions as a socialist package to farmers after he completely fucked them in his trade war.

Or how about the $109 million he has spent golfing, most of which was spent at his own, or his buddies, golf courses?

If you hate the government wasting your taxes, then why aren't you looking at the billions upon billions of dollars that are frivolously wasted in other sectors?

Why only target on the company that single-handedly made EVs popular?

You can't complain about your tax money being wasted and then ignore the cases where 1000x larger amounts are wasted every year and that have zero benefits to the people.

>I also do understand that this is an all EV credit, but Nissan didn‚Äôt take 750m to build leafs, karma didn‚Äôt take 750m to revitalize their company. I don‚Äôt have a problem with them taking risks, I have a problem with direct money being used to fund Tesla and then not delivering. That‚Äôs the point of the article.

Alright, do you have any sources for these 750m that aren't part of this EV credit scheme?

If those are the type of cases you are looking for then look to the Pentagon, look at Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, or the agriculture sectors - literally billions upon billions completely wasted.

I mean, if what you're saying is true then I'd be pissed too - but there are profitable companies taking money and paying it out to their shareholders and top-level management.

You're making comments about space industry, a very specialised and complex space. Unless you work in or around the industry, or have friends who do, it's unlikely you understand the industry enough to assess SpaceX's performance either way.

Reusable launch systems, [including vertical landings](https://youtu.be/JzXcTFfV3Ls?t=73), have been tested before and even used commercially before. There are compromises and challenges with such a system and it's not clearcut if this is a useful feature or not.

The launch market isn't super price sensitive. Customers care more about reliability, customisability etc.

And again, there is nothing here about what the the president has done. It has nothing to do with Trump in any way. If you don‚Äôt like trump, that‚Äôs fine, post your anti trump propaganda elsewhere. It has nothing to do with this at all. In fact, trump has made numerous adjustments to taxes and hasn‚Äôt touched this one, so you should be thrilled at his seemingly supportive position on the EV tax credit. 

Tesla is a growth company that doesn‚Äôt have the money to pay dividends because it would be financially irresponsible for them to do so. They need to reinvest all potential earnings into future development. 

Musk‚Äôs salary isn‚Äôt exactly clear cut, but he does ‚Äúearn‚Äù.

The issue in question wasn‚Äôt his pay. It wasn‚Äôt his salary. The issue was, as the article outlines, Tesla taking 750m from the NY government to maintain the use of the solar city facility in Buffalo New York. Instead they have been laying folks off and not delivering on their support of the community.

The conversation migrated to the EV credit to discuss the fact that Tesla is consistently reliant on government money to maintain and they shouldn‚Äôt be. As a public company they should support themselves. 

If you want to bring up the Nissan Leaf, that‚Äôs fine. But rest assured, Nissan would still be in business without the leaf. They have not taken a check from the government to maintain a factory and support a community. 

That is the problem. And if you want to bring up any other company, my response will be the same, let jpmorgan fall, let Wells Fargo fall, let att fall, Verizon...whatever.

I do know what a ‚Äútax credit‚Äù is, I‚Äôm also smart enough to understand what a budget is, if I‚Äôm crediting someone‚Äôs taxes, the money to fulfill expenses has to come from elsewhere. If everyone‚Äôs tax money goes into a pool, and we start crediting people, that means less tax is collected as a whole. There is an opportunity cost there. It COSTS country‚Äôs tax payers to pay for these things. Through the indirect transfer of money, Tesla benefits, the buyer benefits, everyone else loses. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs 1000 or 8000 per car, it‚Äôs effectively money from the government going to Tesla. Going to a company. The country is not running a balanced budget and we continue to go into debt. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much is given to Tesla, it matters that it‚Äôs given at all. I would much rather see that money go to public programs, schools, hospitals, etc. if Tesla can‚Äôt stand on its own, then it‚Äôs not up to the US government to provide it with financial Viagra. 

Further, this article talks not about these tax credits, it talks about money given to Tesla as a subsidy to support a specific venture. That‚Äôs is tax money given to support the business, in an attempt to support the community. 3/4 of a billion dollars to help Tesla to help a community just by doing business there.

I made a very simple point. One which you have dodged this entire time. 

>Reusable launch systems, including vertical landings, have been tested before and even used commercially before. There are compromises and challenges with such a system and it's not clearcut if this is a useful feature or not.

Were those reusable systems commercialized to bring down the cost? No. SpaceX's system was. Which has been my point this entire time.

157,upvotesthenrages,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/08/how-elon-musk-gambled-tesla-to-save-solarcity,"> Okay, you didn‚Äôt read the article. The article discusses the 750m that was given to Tesla. That‚Äôs what the premise was. That‚Äôs why the discussion revolves around Tesla.

And did you bother looking into what that money went towards?

Those $750m were spent building a solar power plant in Buffalo - the one that was under construction for 4 years and that started producing PVs in 2017 and continues to do so to this day.

So what exactly are you complaining about? That SolarCity didn't do as well as projected? That after Trump's government decided to wreck as much renewable support as possible SolarCity didn't meet it's targets?

That the entire US didn't meet renewable targets in 2017-2019? That almost all CO2 reduction came from switching coal to natural gas, not clean sources?

>And again, there is nothing here about what the the president has done. It has nothing to do with Trump in any way. If you don‚Äôt like trump, that‚Äôs fine, post your anti trump propaganda elsewhere. It has nothing to do with this at all. 

No, you don't get to complain about your tax money being wasted, and then somehow try to limit it to this 1 company. That's not how the world works.

>In fact, trump has made numerous adjustments to taxes and hasn‚Äôt touched this one, so you should be thrilled at his seemingly supportive position on the EV tax credit.

Except for slapping a 30% tariff on the solar panel parts that companies, like SolarCity, import - right?

But hey ... what a supporter, right?

>Tesla is a growth company that doesn‚Äôt have the money to pay dividends because it would be financially irresponsible for them to do so. They need to reinvest all potential earnings into future development.

So they are investing into solar, battery, and EVs - how horrible.

I'm still struggling to grasp exactly what your gripe is? Did you just read that article and get mad, or what's up?

>The issue in question wasn‚Äôt his pay. It wasn‚Äôt his salary. The issue was, as the article outlines, Tesla taking 750m from the NY government to maintain the use of the solar city facility in Buffalo New York. Instead they have been laying folks off and not delivering on their support of the community.

Yeah, and like has been explained - the 30% increase in purchasing cells & components directly affects SolarCity's ability to sell.

It'd be fucking irresponsible to keep people on the payroll if they aren't necessary and you aren't turning a profit.

>The conversation migrated to the EV credit to discuss the fact that Tesla is consistently reliant on government money to maintain and they shouldn‚Äôt be. As a public company they should support themselves.

That's true of practically every company on the planet. This libertarian dream of private companies carrying themselves is so silly.

The roads companies use, the educated people they hire, the healthy people they hire, the technology available to them, the amount of fucking subsidies that every company on earth receives from governments all over is astounding.

R&D in practically every field is so heavily subsidized by governments that we should all be living in a world where we didn't pay taxes - simply due to the fact that governments could be charging royalties on patent usage.

Airlines, Taxi's, Uber, and every geo-location based service is subsidized by the US army via GPS usage.

Every person in every developed nation on earth has the majority of their healthcare paid for by the government, that includes the USA.

Every nation on earth pays for the vast majority of their populations education - that includes the USA.

Now, we are subsidizing a few different technologies because they are going to be a huge benefit to our society. Tesla is the single largest company that focused on those technologies.

GE could have transitioned, Ford could have transitioned ... anybody could have. But they didn't. Instead of doing R&D and pushing for new tech they spent the money lobbying governments to stall and delay.

This 750m was spent on a factory that NY state still owns. It's literally been a few years, and due to an idiotic trade war things aren't going as planned.

In 2016, nobody in their right mind would have predicted a trade war with the largest producers of solar tech.

>That is the problem. And if you want to bring up any other company, my response will be the same, let jpmorgan fall, let Wells Fargo fall, let att fall, Verizon...whatever. If they can‚Äôt stand on their own, the US taxpayers shouldn‚Äôt foot the bill. Further, as long as the government props these companies up, smaller companies have a barrier to entry in challenging them.

Are you even listening? You seem to agree in half your post, then immediately turn around and mental gymnastic your way back.

Tesla is not being subsidized. Solar, battery, and EV tech is.

*Anybody* who is involved in those fields can qualify. That¬®s not an entry barrier ... it's the opposite.

EV's wouldn't even exist in a competitive fashion if governments all over the world hadn't subsidized them - and now governments all over the world are planning to end those subsidies because EVs are becoming competitive.

Same thing goes for wind & solar. You're just ignorant about it because the US played a minor role in it.

The EU & China have been carrying wind & solar to where it is today. The US, under Bush, decided to not partake in any effort to curb global warming - Obama turned that a bit and then Trump immediately messed it all up again.

I understand perfectly what an example is. When it in no way mirrors reality, I call that an ""agenda"".

>I do know what a ‚Äútax credit‚Äù is, I‚Äôm also smart enough to understand what a budget is, if I‚Äôm crediting someone‚Äôs taxes, the money to fulfill expenses has to come from elsewhere.

Or expenditures need to be reduced.

>If everyone‚Äôs tax money goes into a pool, and we start crediting people, that means less tax is collected as a whole.

I'm perfectly fine with that. The less money stolen by the government, the better in my book.

> There is an opportunity cost there.

There's also an opportunity cost in not taxing everyone at 100%.

> It COSTS country‚Äôs tax payers to pay for these things.

It costs taxpayers to pay for everything. Shall we shut down the EPA?

>Through the indirect transfer of money, Tesla benefits, the buyer benefits, everyone else loses.

I don't disagree. I wouldn't lose any sleep if that tax credit program were abolished. In fact, I'm fairly surprised it survived the Trump tax plan. Still, how does this call into question Musk's ""integrity""?

>It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs 1000 or 8000 per car, it‚Äôs effectively money from the government going to Tesla. Going to a company.

Where are the tears for oil subsidies?

>The country is not running a balanced budget and we continue to go into debt.

Sounds like we better cut expenditures.

> It doesn‚Äôt matter how much is given to Tesla, it matters that it‚Äôs given at all. I would much rather see that money go to public programs, schools, hospitals, etc.

And I would rather see that money not confiscated by the government at all. Which, I remind you, is exactly what a tax credit does.

> if Tesla can‚Äôt stand on its own, then it‚Äôs not up to the US government to provide it with financial Viagra. 

I agree.

>Further, this article talks not about these tax credits, it talks about money given to Tesla as a subsidy to support a specific venture. That‚Äôs is tax money given to support the business, in an attempt to support the community. 3/4 of a billion dollars to help Tesla to help a community just by doing business there. 

I agree that that's not the government's place. However, it's New York's business how they want to spend the money they've taken from their residents.

>I take issue with any company who takes a subsidy from the government to do business. That‚Äôs not capitalism. If your company cannot survive on its own, it shouldn‚Äôt be in business.

168,gyro_g,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/08/how-elon-musk-gambled-tesla-to-save-solarcity,"First off, you keep referring to the trade war as ‚Äúidiotic‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think you understand it. So let me help you out here. The ‚Äútrade war‚Äù exists because the playing field between the US and China is not even. Chinese goods are cheaper than US goods, both in China and in the US. Part of that stems from cost of production, it is expensive to produce goods in the US due to labor costs (higher min wage) and higher workplace standards (insurance costs, work place standards, etc.). If we want to take the US good to China and sell it, we have to pay the Chinese government to allow that to happen. That‚Äôs the tariff we have been paying. The more expensive US good then becomes even MORE expensive, which makes it even harder to compete with the cheaper Chinese domestic good on price. So we don‚Äôt have as much access to the chinese markets with our goods. Further, the tariffs we do pay, go to support the Chinese government that doesn‚Äôt pay those higher wages for its people or maintain the working standards we are accustomed to here. That would be fine...but, when it comes to doing the same here, we never charged China the same tariffs to bring their goods to the US, which means they can maintain the lower prices here. That means they can compete with our products at home and abroad. We don‚Äôt get to do the same? The tariff war started because we asked to have the tariffs removed. Allow a level playing field. Our markets open to you, and yours to us. China said no. So if that‚Äôs the case, they were will do likewise. Increased tariffs on China. They raise tariffs, we raise them and etc. it‚Äôs an unfair system. Whether you like Donald trump or not, the fact that we are being taken advantage of as a country is bullshit. Regardless of how long it has gone on, it‚Äôs bullshit. 

I don‚Äôt care if you agree with that or not, but to blame the ‚Äútrade war‚Äù for any of this is irresponsible. If the Chinese weren‚Äôt taking advantage, there would be no tariffs, we could produce everything more economically and then ship our stuff to China to be sold, and their stuff here. One step closer to the utopian economy we all want, right?

The $750m went toward bringing that buffalo plant to a point of production to support the community. Tesla is building plants elsewhere and could have shifted production to that plant to help the community as they were paid to do. They didn‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs not my job to identify alternative practices to help Tesla keep their word or live up to expectations. They took the money, they should find a way to make it work for them. 

It‚Äôs not my tax dollars, I‚Äôm not butthurt about anything, my problem is the propping up of any company. I don‚Äôt care what they make. They could make solar power dildos that hold mp3s and teleport people, it wouldn‚Äôt matter. If you are taking money, find a way to make it work. Otherwise it‚Äôs taking advantage. There is an ethical issue there and I question the integrity of someone who does that. 

EVs being subsidized isn‚Äôt the main problem, although it is part of the problem. The business model with EVs has been ‚Äúthe car costs 50k, but you only pay 42k, the government will pay us the 8k‚Äù. That‚Äôs an issue. The money comes from everyone. When the government needs to recoup that money to TRY to balance the budget, that‚Äôs a problem. Who is getting the money? The multi billion dollar company? They have investors who can invest for a return. They can be invested in all the wonderful environment saving tech you talked about. And it‚Äôs great, I‚Äôm happy it exists, but let the investors pay. They are willing to. But here‚Äôs the other issue, they have paid, and Tesla has gone to the well over and over and over again. They‚Äôve issued debt and equity in multiple rounds and they have taken advantage of subsidies and everything else and their debt ratios are disgusting. Their practices (announcing the retirement of their CTO on a quarterly call, questionable purchase of Solar City, continued requests for funding after not meeting quotas, inabilities to perform, lawsuits, etc.) all raise red flags. You wanted to talk about their dividends and stock, look at their financials. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter to me what Tesla does. Whether they succeed or fail is inconsequential to me. But there are other who have staked their livelihoods on the success of that company. The state of New York invested in them. Citizens of New York made an investment in them. Here‚Äôs this factory with a $750m backing to help them get started and Tesla is shopping sites around the world for another factory???? Come on man, you have to see the issue here. If solar panels are not working, build your cars there. You have trouble meeting quotas in the factories you have, so convert a portion of the 1.2m sq feet to help build them in Buffalo. Keep those folks on staff. Be responsible for your shit. 

And with regard to government funding and barriers to entry... government resources allocated to public companies does indeed create barriers to entry. I‚Äôm not talking about an EV credit. That is available to everyone, I‚Äôm talking about giving them 750m to help aide in the purchase of solar city which was showing negative trends. Tesla buying them and getting help in the sale to the tune of 750m, which was at the base of the whole argument. Let them fall. Someone else will build a solar company and run it properly. Then there will be competitors who follow a similar model and create competition, driving prices down and making solar panels more affordable for everything. That‚Äôs how capitalism works. 

And if you are worried about grand scale adoption of clean tech, the idea of no tariffs for all should be even more appealing. On a macro economic scale, no barriers to trade mean price competition and lower prices for everyone all over the world. There could be solar panels built here, using Chinese goods and sent to China to be sold next to Chinese solar panels and a price war could begin. But that‚Äôs not how things are. The same would happen for EVs. Cheaper to make, cheaper to move, cheaper to buy...more EVs, reduces planetary impact. 

Also, you should read the lawsuits against solar city and Tesla. Beyond the shoddy quality which has caused fires at Walmart and Amazon, the purchase of the company by Tesla was more than questionable. His cousin was the cofounder and the company was trending downward, so the acquisition took place and raised a lot of questions, which are yet unanswered. The price also seems questionable with valuations, and he borrowed the money through a stock issuance to complete the purchase, citing vertical integration as his motive. However, many Tesla shareholders were not into the acquisition. They are the ones filing suit. 

My positions was, is and will remain, the government, should not be subsidizing Tesla. When they do, questionable things happen. Also think about this, do you want the government having control over corporations? Do you want them working with corporations? Think about what that does to credibility of either. 

So yes, I do question the integrity of Elon Musk. This article reinforces that. I‚Äôm sorry we disagree. I‚Äôm sorry you take issue with my position, but I‚Äôve provided substantiation for my position and I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt really see any argument to the contrary. I would absolutely buy an EV. I would buy a Karma in a heartbeat. Their reuse of resources and innovation is great. They haven‚Äôt been successful, but hopefully the new ownership group work to turn that around. I just would not buy a Tesla because I don‚Äôt agree with their ownership. I‚Äôm only one person, I don‚Äôt expect to change anyone‚Äôs mind or have any impact on their success. They will either do well or they won‚Äôt and it will have nothing to do with me.",tech,t2_lp7uy,cvhvsq,ey4wkw8,/r/tech/comments/cvhvsq/hes_full_of_shit_how_elon_musk_gambled_tesla_to/ey4wkw8/,/r/tech/comments/cvhvsq/hes_full_of_shit_how_elon_musk_gambled_tesla_to/
169,gyro_g,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/08/how-elon-musk-gambled-tesla-to-save-solarcity,"This is my last response on the matter because it‚Äôs kind of silly to continue this at this point. 

You may understand perfectly what an example is, but the $8k figure was used an example is not an ‚Äúagenda‚Äù when the tax credit was $7500 up until December 1 of last year. I‚Äôm sure you can google that and find the results rather easily.

Expenditures do need to be reduced. We are in agreement there, but let‚Äôs face it, we don‚Äôt live in a time when people are calling for a reduction in expenditures. People are asking for subsidized college, subsidized health care, higher wages etc. that‚Äôs a completely different matter, but the point is, people are not asking the government for less. They are asking for more. 

We actually do agree on a lot of points. I would certainly be happy to pay less tax, but it‚Äôs just not feasible. I pay my share, but I wish it were less. But I understand that my money goes to help run the country and that‚Äôs fine. I live here and I‚Äôm good with that. 

I called into question Musk‚Äôs integrity for how he handled the solar city deal and how he took money without delivering. The details surrounding the solar city deal caused quite a few lawsuits, you can look that up, there are a number of reasons outside of taking state money to do something and not delivering. That‚Äôs just the premise of my argument in this case. It‚Äôs outlined by the article. 

Again, I don‚Äôt think any subsidies of public companies is correct, it destroys capitalism, oil, a solar power plant to be converted to a giga factory, whatever. This is partially why. The government gives you money that people have paid for the betterment of society, he took the cash and hasn‚Äôt delivered. People worked hard for that money. People didn‚Äôt get things they wanted to pay the taxes that funded this. Let the tax payers keep it instead. 

And I see that there is opportunity to take advantage of these things. Trust me, I get it, which is why I call the integrity into question.

If you left it with the $750 million from NY to call into question integrity, I might agree with you. At the same time, that's kinda what you sign up for if you're a NY taxpayer. Either way, if SolarCity's terms for that ""incentive"" (I didn't find any solid source indicating whether it was a tax break or cash) then yes, I think that's a problem.

But to call into question the EV credit is where I really disagree. The entire point of that credit is to get more EVs sold in the US. Whether you agree with that as a worthy motive is irrelevant (I don't fully agree myself); that's what the credit is for. And those terms were satisfied 100%.

And I used the $8k as an example, a proxy because it was the standard for the vast majority of the time Tesla has existed.

And I tried to provide sources to support everything because I don‚Äôt like to just spout shit out without being able to substantiate it. That‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt do anyone any good.

But I think we can also agree that at no point, should the blame be put on the taxpayer for paying taxes, watching the state government turn around and give that money to a company, and that company not delivering, and then saying ‚Äúwell, you chose to live in New York‚Äù. Like that‚Äôs not how things should be. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs not how it‚Äôs viewed, I‚Äôm saying that is not how it should be. I think we could probably agree there as well. 

We also agree on the EV credit‚Äôs validity. Whether or not it is a ‚Äúworthy motive‚Äù. 

Forget everything else for a second. The main point is that a government should not be propping up any company. Taxpayers shouldn‚Äôt pay for the company to exist, and if you take something from a government, your intention should be to fucking deliver no matter what. There are too many livelihoods at stake.

Broadly, the purpose of moderation is to enforce community standards which does (at least for this subreddit) include maintaining constructive discussion, yes. 

Having said that, we try not to intervene with discussion at all if possible, preferring community moderation (voting) to do its thing, except in circumstances where we draw the line on what is unambiguously unacceptable behaviour.

In just about every way possible. Low earth orbit instead of geosynchronous, so they're thirty times closer, which makes the latency better than fiber.

It's in the Ka band, which has **WAY** more bandwidth. It uses beam forming, which means they can reuse the same frequency over and over in different geographic areas.

Self driving requires millisecond response times. Networking doesn't really help much, other than maybe local peer to peer connections to nearby cars.

Also, these satellites require a pretty big antenna to work, and they don't work well if they move.

The usecase is similar to a satellite dish on the roof of a house. This stuff will never work for a cellphone or something.

And there's no ""they'll figure some advanced tech eventually"" The laws of physics require an antenna about the size of a pizza box. You can't go smaller. For cars it just makes more sense to stick with cell phone mobile networks.

329,faizimam,https://www.wired.co.uk/article/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-satellite-launch,"> This is not a cheap replacement for fiber

Its even worse than you say. 

Each satellite can provide a dozen gigabits or so. Maybe in the future a few hundered gigabits.

And even when the network is complete, there will be a few dozen sats visible in the sky at any given time. That means a given city will have a few terabits of bandwidth available to it.

If you're in some rural area, its great. Plenty to go around. But in any major city you can only divide that up between a few tens of thousands of people before its saturated.

If you're living in Los Angeles and have shitty internet for example. This won't help you.  

Though it does raise the question. How will Starlink allocate those tens of thousands of ""slots"" in a given area? Demand will dramatically outstrip supply. Institutional or business users only? focus on cheap access for the poor?

 Its up to them. But I guess if they cap speeds to 10mbps or something, they could accommodate quite a lot. But is there a market for that vs conventional?

But from a public policy perspective, this is great, since it works exactly the opposite from Fiber. So you can have this for low density, and save the money for expensive fibre installation in the places where the density actually justifies the expense.",tech,t2_hl49fcs,bsv6c4,eotwn5t,/r/tech/comments/bsv6c4/elon_musk_just_ignited_the_race_to_build_the/eotwn5t/,/r/tech/comments/bsv6c4/elon_musk_just_ignited_the_race_to_build_the/

That places a pretty low total capacity of a few hundred gigabits, maybe a few terabits, total? In a given point on the globe.

That means if you are in the middle of nowhere, its awesome. But in urban areas with millions of people, you have to share and thus the allocation per person will have to be very small, or else they will need to cap the total number of users.

The antenna looks like a large Frizbee, It won't fit in a A frame. Sure you might be able to hack in into the flat part of the roof, but there really isn't a point. Starlink offers you very little that a normal mobile network doesn't do better.

409,troyunrau,https://www.wired.co.uk/article/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-satellite-launch,"You are correct. The current rockets that SpaceX uses burns a highly refined form of kerosene (fossil fuel). It spits out mostly water and carbon dioxide when it is burning, as well as some soot and other things. It is by no means a clean burning engine. 

However, both they (and their competitor Blue Origin) are working on methane engines. While still a fossil fuel, this burns much cleaner (no soot - like a natural gas stovetop). But, more importantly, it can be made to be carbon neutral in the future.

See, one of SpaceX's goals is to establish a human colony on Mars. Mars doesn't have fossil fuels. So to launch rockets, you need a fuel that can be made on Mars. Mars has a carbon dioxide atmosphere, and water (in the form of ice). Combining these two (and a bunch of energy, likely from solar panels), you can effectively run the combustion process in reverse to create the fuel. So this technology needs to be developed if we have a hope in hell of getting the Mars colony off the ground. (The reaction is called the Sebatier reaction, discovered a century ago.)

So the good news is that they're developing a rocket that uses a fuel that can be made from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water. And Elon owns a solar panel factory (via Tesla). So it is very likely that the next iteration of their rockets will be extraction carbon dioxide from the air, converting it into methane, then launching the rocket and converting it back into carbon dioxide. Lather, rinse, repeat. You now have a carbon neutral rocket fuel. If you can do it on Mars, you can do it on Earth.

Of course, some rockets are already fine in this sense - the ones that burn hydrogen fuel. The space shuttle main engines used this. If you burn hydrogen, the only exhaust is water, so removes carbon from the entire equation. It's just that liquid hydrogen is a bitch, and very expensive/complicated. And if we want cheaper rockets, hydrogen is not in the cards.",tech,t2_hl49fcs,bsv6c4,eoty6fj,/r/tech/comments/bsv6c4/elon_musk_just_ignited_the_race_to_build_the/eoty6fj/,/r/tech/comments/bsv6c4/elon_musk_just_ignited_the_race_to_build_the/

A few hundred pounds of thrust to create downforce, for a few critical seconds, would make a big difference when cornering. Possibly when accelerating too. You need to remember, the limiting factor (for the high-end of teslas) is really tire adhesion, not horse power. 

The idea of using thrust to lift, hover, or particularly ‚Äúfly‚Äú the car is so ridiculous that it barely warrants discussion.  For starters, the suspension in a road car could not handle a drop of more than a few inches. So, the trust would need to be maintained, and controlled, as the car lifted, and landed.  That would mean in a enormous amount of thrust, for a comically impractical amount of time (vs something that might be useful to help with cornering or down force). Also, why lift the car if it‚Äôs not moving? ....And, if it was moving, how the hell would you control it once it left the ground?

I am not assuming the car will actually float, technically speak Musk never said that. He only said that the Roadster would use pressured gas to lift higher. The only reason I could think for this is to elevate the car when it starts reaching max speed, so the wheels are able to rotate faster and keep accelerating the car, reaching a higher top-speed at the cost of max acceleration near its limit. At that point though you'd probably want some sort of turbine or something to be able to take over the now very inefficient wheels, and god forbid you need to turn any amount of degrees.

The other option is that they do push downwards (and in another direction) and Musk is insisting ""but then if the car has rockets we could make it fly for a second"" not understanding they are pushing the car downwards.",tech,t2_11m3sc,aem693,educo5x,/r/tech/comments/aem693/elon_musk_new_tesla_roadster_will_use_thrusters/educo5x/,/r/tech/comments/aem693/elon_musk_new_tesla_roadster_will_use_thrusters/

To answer both of your questions, I think musk is talking out his ass again and the final car will have a whopping 0 rocket thrusters on it

So other people aren‚Äôt confused by your dumbass pseudoscience, thrust is a force created by the explulsion of accelerated particles (jet fuel flying out of the engine). Downforce is caused by the difference in pressure between the top and bottom of the wing (or entire car). Angular velocity is the speed at which something is rotating, so downforce has literally zero affect on the angular velocity of a car. And thrust vectoring (which I‚Äôm not convinced you even know what that means at this point) literally just means aiming a thruster somewhere to get a desired affect, so no it‚Äôs not anything that affects angular velocity

Two fans at the rear of the car driven by a dedicated two-stroke engine draw large amounts of air from under the chassis, reducing pressure and creating downforce.

I work in undersea propulsion systems, so replace air with hydro and most of the same concepts apply.

Engineers are theory to practice, so let‚Äôs see you try to evaluate something:

I‚Äôd say reading comprehension right back at you but you‚Äôve made it clear time and again that YOU DONT ACTUALLY READ lol 

But just as a thought experiment, the benefits of a hovering passenger vehicle, which by the way already exist, is that it could work on land, water and a whole bunch of other terrains. I would‚Äôve thought that someone who works in hydro propulsion would‚Äôve known we had hovercrafts since the 50s.

Edit: you are literally writing what the brabham car does now and still can‚Äôt admit it has nothing to do with thrust vectoring.

Yeah, you know, I really don‚Äôt get why people post his stuff on here. 

Also, I‚Äôm really enjoying the current anti-bandwagon era we‚Äôre in. For awhile, people hopped on bandwagons and were called sheeple for doing things like liking Apple or liking Elon Musk. 

And now you‚Äôre sheeple and just a bandwagon-er if you hate Apple or hate Elon Musk. 

I will never understand the mentality behind ‚ÄúFuck that guy! He‚Äôs saving our planet?? Fuck him! He‚Äôs just doing it for the attention and to feed his ego!‚Äù

Like ??? He‚Äôs *literally* just trying to save the planet. So yeah, fuck him if he‚Äôs found a way to make money from it, right? 

What I think is really funny is his cars are affordable too. $30,000 new and like $20,000 used for the lower tier ones that will give you way better performance than combustion engine cars, PLUS you don‚Äôt pay for gas, electricity is wayyyy cheaper.

775,BullockHouse,https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/01/elon-musk-is-really-really-excited-about-his-starship/,"We don't have a ton of details, but I've done some research because I'm curious. Note that I am not remotely a physicist or aerospace engineer, so apply a healthy amount of salt to all of this. It's based on my limited understanding of the mechanics involved. 

It seems similar to some of the early plans for the shuttle heat shield, using hot-body design. The idea is that stainless steel reflects the IR to visible spectrum well, which is where the peak of the emissions from the superheated plasma are. As such, the vehicle will be able to mostly avoid radiative heating, leaving the primary source of heating direct conduction from the plasma itself. This is helpful, because (as I understand it) once you get up into the orbital re-entry ballistic regime, radiative heating is where almost all of the heat actually comes from. 

This is a different sort of design from conventional black heat shield tiles, which are intended to absorb the radiative heating, reach equilibrium temperature and then radiate heat back out as efficiently as possible, while insulating the rest of the airframe. 

The idea here is to try to reflect heat so efficiently that the body doesn't have time to heat to a fatal temperature before re-entry completes, rather than accepting that the windward side is going to get very hot and trying to insulate the rest of the airframe from it.

The other part of the puzzle is using the thermal capacity of the airframe's steel as a heat sink, to deal with the heat that does get absorbed. Presumably the math indicates this isn't quite good enough to keep the steel under its annealing temperature, so the plan is to evaporate the methane inside channels in the windward side to get rid of a few extra megajoules of heat energy to provide safety margin. It's similar to what they do with the raptor engine bells already.

That's the theory anyway. I'm not qualified to do the math to see if it actually checks out, but I assume SpaceX have some convincing simulations that say it's worth pursuing.

Black body radiation and conduction from plasma is far from the only thing to contend with on reentry, even if it constitutes the majority of the heating.

They want the vehicles to be good for rapid reusability, and their chosen fuel is dirt cheap, so they intend to launch a tanker upper stage into orbit and use it as a fuel depot, return the booster to pad, put another tanker on it, rendezvous with the depot and transfer fuel, and redo this until the depot is full (with some 1100 tons of fuel, equivalent to ~35 orange tanks), then launch a manned vehicle, which is basically the same upper stage except now with enough payload that it can only barely make it to orbit with dry tanks, rendezvous with the depot and fill it up, then head to mars.

Much of their reasoning is that unlike with KSP, building identical vehicles is much, much cheaper than designing purpose-built ideal things for each task. They intend to use the same upper stage with only modifications in the cargo area as the satellite launcher, fuel tanker, fuel depot, cargo hauler, crewed earth ascent vehicle, mars transfer vehicle, mars descent vehicle, mars ascent vehicle, and return vehicle to earth.

As an aside, that's hilarious. I'm going to have to pass that along to my materials science friend, if he's not already familiar.

Back on topic:

I know they're planning to cold-form large parts of the body, which might help with hardness and structural integrity.

A relevant data point is maybe [STS-27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-27), which was a secret military shuttle mission during which the heat shield was damaged by a foam strike, and wasn't repaired due to secrecy (and a strong measure of incompetence). 

Despite a fairly large hole in the heat shield, the shuttle was able to re-enter because the hole was over a large steel structural element that was able to take the heat of re-entry even without the shield.

That's maybe encouraging for the prospects of the vehicle surviving a non-nominal re-entry (or the failure of the active cooling system, which makes me nervous). I think the line there is that it's okay if the vehicle has to be thrown away due to material degradation after a failure of the active cooling system, but it's not okay if that failure causes the vehicle to break up or heat to a fatal temperature. 

One thing that *does* help is that there isn't a foam-insulated cryo tank above the orbiter, which was one of the major flaws in the shuttle design. The ice and foam forms a composite material that's much stronger and more dangerous than just ice itself, and the shuttle's heat shield was directly in the path of falling debris, both from the tank and from the boosters. Whereas with a more conventional booster configuration, any ice or debris should fall away from the orbiter, not towards them.

My only real concern there would be the winglets. If they lose one to an ice strike from the upper body, it might really harm the ability of the guidance computer to maintain attitude control of the vehicle.

And you'll be wrong. 

The reason you are going to be downvoted is that you are trying to convince people that have just witnessed Musk's biggest passion project, the one he has poured most of his money and soul into, succeed beyond most people's expectations, and you don't even mention that in your unbeleivably biased screed. No doubt you'll try to downplay his success in SpaceX, saying ""It wasn't him it was his engineers"" (As if that's not true of every technological accomplishment of appreciable scale in the past 50 years), or saying that it still isn't anything new (Right, because reusable rockets landing on a barge is a commonplace accomplishment). 

Your problem isn't even that you dislike someone that other people like. It's that you have so little perspective that your reaction to seeing other people looking up to a figure and finding out that the figure has not succeeded in many of his accomplishments is to immediately swing like a pendulum from ""He's a pretty cool guy"" to ""He's the worst thing ever"".

1128,willrandship,https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-big-falcon-spaceship-construction-musk-mars-missions-2018-9,"It's not as bad as you think. When you're burning CH4+O2 -> H2O + CO2, you're only bringing 1/4 of the mass of your fuel, and 1/12 of the mass of your total fuel+oxidizer.

If that means you spend less time on the martian surface, then you need less supply mass, and potentially less equipment as well.

Extracting the water from martian soil is not a bad idea, but there are a lot of factors to keep in mind.

* [The martian soil contains ~1L of water per ft^3](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/167581-mars-soil-contains-a-large-percentage-of-water-reports-nasas-curiosity-rover).
  * This is ~35L per m^3. It's a lot, but rockets need a lot of fuel too.
* The lander stage holds 240 metric tons of CH4
  * The hydrogen takes up ~1/4 of this mass (C = 12 AMU, H = 1)
  * This gives ~60 metric tons of hydrogen to extract or bring along.
* Extracting that much hydrogen from the ground would take ~540 metric tons of liquid water, which is ~540k liters.
* Using the above density of water on mars, you'd need to mine out 15000 m^3 of soil to extract enough hydrogen for a total refuel.

That's a lot of dirt to move, so you're going to need some heavy equipment to get it done in any reasonable timeframe. It's certainly not impossible, and likely a better solution in the long term, but that equipment will weigh quite a bit, and there's a lot of uncertainty involved. For example, what if your solar-electric bulldozer fails 3 months into your 6 month refueling? It's simpler and more reliable to bring the H2 along.",tech,t2_368ud,9ge9tz,e63t9z3,/r/tech/comments/9ge9tz/elon_musk_is_building_a_spaceship_thats_so/e63t9z3/,/r/tech/comments/9ge9tz/elon_musk_is_building_a_spaceship_thats_so/

1196,willrandship,https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-big-falcon-spaceship-construction-musk-mars-missions-2018-9,"Methane and kerosene (RP-1) are both common choices for modern rocket propellants.

There are two factors at work: fuel density, and vapor pressure.

Hydrogen, per weight, is the best fuel. However, it takes up more volume. Liquid hydrogen weighs ~70 kg/m^3. Liquid methane weighs ~380 kg/m^3, and kerosene takes up 820 kg/m^3. That means for the same tank, you can fit more fuel. If your tank's weight is negligible, then you want hydrogen, but it's not negligible.

The second problem is pressure. In order to maintain liquid state, hydrogen has to be kept very cold. As it heats up, the pressure of the container rises very quickly as it boils. Hydrogen cannot maintain liquid state above 33 K at all, so if you plan on having the fuel above that you'll need a very sturdy (5k-10k PSI) tank, which obviously weighs a lot.

Kerosene, on the other hand, is liquid at room temperature. You just need a container that can physically hold it and withstand the forces of the rocket.

Methane is a compromise between these two. It can be stored much more easily than hydrogen, but not as easily as kerosene. However, its fuel performance is higher than kerosene's, but lower than hydrogen's, per mass.

tl;dr: Hydrogen needs big strong tanks. Kerosene burns worse, but doesn't need very strong tanks. Methane is a compromise between these two goals.",tech,t2_368ud,9ge9tz,e64cyyt,/r/tech/comments/9ge9tz/elon_musk_is_building_a_spaceship_thats_so/e64cyyt/,/r/tech/comments/9ge9tz/elon_musk_is_building_a_spaceship_thats_so/

It's not a perfect solution.

Bringing along an extra couple tons of hydrogen is trivial compared to a device that will harvest water and split it.

The goal is easy, dependable, cheap solution to provide fuel on Mars. That's why this process works, because you don't have to worry about landing within a water source or mining the water source. You just land it, and have it autonomously spit out fuel.

1407,lookmeat,https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-spacex-mars-plan-timeline-2018-10,"That actually is the least of our trouble. There's a lot of ways of protecting humans in deep space, even at large times. Sure cancer rates may be higher for those that do the trip, but everyone understands that this is one of the smaller risks of becoming a mars colonist.

I agree that the timeline is very speculative and becomes very aggressive towards the middle, and very optimistic if outright misguided by the end.

I do actually think that before 2025 there'll be resources and partial bases sent to Mars. I also suspect that similar projects for the moon (and a prediction of the Mars challenges at that) will happen around the same time. Once SpaceX is able to load resources that high and send ships to and back from the moon it'll make sense. Also it'll make it convenient to get metals and resources on space. We may see the first true attempts at space manufacturing happen between 2025-2030. I expect unique challenges will arise.

I also think that humans may reach mars between 2025-2030 assuming that the engineering works very well and aggressively fast. I expect Mars Base Alpha to be just a couple buildings smaller than a house which are used to run experiments by 2030, and that is optimistic. I expect new challenges in actually growing crops in effective manners in Mars, maintaining such small ecosystems in balance, handling the lower energy (as we're further away from the sun) and other small details. I do think that there'll be inefficient but manageable ways to get water and oxygen early on, but without food sources it'll be hard to get more than a few people in. Once the problem is seen and understood, work towards a solution may happen. I expect that genetic modification and improvements will make this more and more possible, and by 2050 we could have actual food growing in Mars.

So here's my prediction. Optimistically by 2050 we'll see the first actually effective farms in Mars, and the first long-term (like multiple year) Martian people staying. I would expect that the population would stay in the hundreds for a long time, with most of the industry being managing automated mining of asteroids (if such thing is feasible) otherwise it'll stay mostly a project for those with ambitions. The martian project may gain traction as things (for human civilizations) in Earth worsen and countries scramble to maintain their power in a planet with new weather patterns, coastlines and water sources, the oceans and space would seem like a more stable source of power and it might just be in their power to seek it. I expect that militarization of space would speed up its colonization, but slow down Mars' colonization if asteroid mining doesn't become a thing by then. Keeping on a very optimistic timeline, if asteroid and Martian mining become a thing, then we might see a colony with thousands, maybe even single millions, by 2100 (even when food and resources are available, Mars will have **very** limited growth because of tech limitations early on). I also expect that by this time a lot of energy would be formed in generating multiple large cities, instead of a single one with various colonies nearby. I don't expect any attempts to truly terraform Mars any earlier than 2500 even being optimistically, as it'd be a lot easier to simply keep building new colonies around the planet before it became so expensive to keep building, while at the same time only then would you have enough man-power and spread out resources that it'd make sense to invest in such an insane challenge. Personally I think that colonization of Mars will be slower than expected as the moon becomes more attractive initially (though the moon will never reach Mars' self-sustainability, it will have better access to Earth which makes it a better colony). Mars in many ways will be more independent, though I imagine that multiple colonies will form and initially there'll be many internal wars and strife (I doubt that the planet will be able to effectively unify without better space transport, but then again 500 years is a range were a lot of things can happen).",tech,t2_368ud,9od1k6,e7u28vb,/r/tech/comments/9od1k6/this_speculative_spacex_timeline_reveals_roughly/e7u28vb/,/r/tech/comments/9od1k6/this_speculative_spacex_timeline_reveals_roughly/

1422,fourthletter,https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-spacex-mars-plan-timeline-2018-10,"I'll just post the article - 

A new study published by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has thrown a major wrench into the government‚Äôs pipe dream of one day sending actual human beings to Mars.

According to the study‚Äôs findings, the excessive amount of travel time that would be required to get astronauts all the way to the fourth body in the Milky Way would ultimately kill them ‚Äì the reason being that these astronauts‚Äô gut bacteria would become completely depleted long before they even set foot on the Red Planet.

This revelation mirrors the results of earlier studies that came to similar conclusions from the perspective of brain function. Sitting in a spaceship for such a long period of time would not only lead to astronauts prematurely aging, but would also destroy their brains, possibly rendering them as human ‚Äúvegetables.‚Äù

The biggest issue seems to be all of the violently thrashing radiation that‚Äôs constantly moving through space. Long space journeys would expose astronauts to levels of radiation so high that their bodies would essentially end up shutting down and dying.

NASA researchers verified this by testing such a scenario on experimental mice. They learned that the mice‚Äôs bodies weren‚Äôt keen on receiving the equivalent amounts of space radiation that astronauts would receive while traveling from Earth to Mars.

‚ÄúHeavy ions such as iron and silicon are damaging because of their greater mass compared to no-mass photons such as x-rays and gamma (?)-rays prevalent on earth as well as low mass protons in outer space,‚Äù says Kamal Datta, a senior scientist both at NASA and the Georgetown University Medical Center, and the study‚Äôs lead author.",tech,t2_368ud,9od1k6,e7trip6,/r/tech/comments/9od1k6/this_speculative_spacex_timeline_reveals_roughly/e7trip6/,/r/tech/comments/9od1k6/this_speculative_spacex_timeline_reveals_roughly/

That is an interesting parallel to make to self driving cars because I agree chauffeur & passenger roles are the end goal, but I disagree that this applies to the current state of self driving or specifically Uber here.

Current state is somewhat more like student driver & instructor roles given that Uber calls the instructor-type role ""the operator"". They are expected to regularly monitor the various outputs & indicators from the car, yet provided no instructor indicator (alarm or not) of possible danger. It's also a legal grey area where liability could fall to either role, knowing that the operator *could* have done something.

There are notable challenges here that need to be handled before the student driver who killed a person gets handed the keys again, let alone gets a license to drive without assistance. So it would seem you're proposing that we could have the car brake even at some ""uncomfortable"" speeds when a person is detected (an acceleration threshold would be exceeded like it did in the AZ Uber incident)? I think this can help many situations, even if it results in false positives, but I am shocked that Uber isn't doing more to put driving liability on the operator instead of their self driving cars. I guess the issue with that is then it would reduce self driving technology to an aid, with less hope for it to become self sufficient.",tech,t2_368ud,8todh7,e1bduoa,/r/tech/comments/8todh7/tesla_autopilot_has_an_actual_mad_max_mode_in/e1bduoa/,/r/tech/comments/8todh7/tesla_autopilot_has_an_actual_mad_max_mode_in/

This is a pretty weird way to look at it.. and I hoped to make that point with the chauffeur metaphor. The thing is you have to act with *beyond-human* reaction time to handle a situation that a self-driving car gets confused with. The alarms would be useless because they would happen too late for human to react and would be constantly buzzing every 5 seconds anyways. Literally every time you pass a parked car (or get close to any large thing) is when the blind-spot alarm would go off.  
  
Some SDC operators do spend a lot of time looking at the display, and I think various ones show danger levels of surrounding objects, and which ones are detected.. A dash-mounted ""danger"" indicator with arrows-or-something would be a pretty good idea.

> Current state is somewhat more like student driver & instructor

I think ""student"" is too generous. More like ""alien that crash-landed on earth and appears to be in a delirious-teenager state and is constantly making mistakes, and has proven not to learn from mistakes or care about it's own mortality.. but we can change how it works by programming it"". Lets let that drive us around.

~  
  
The Uber incident is still sort of unexplained.. Like there were multiple systems that detected the lady but the car just wasn't programed to brake. The car does not learn from its mistakes, the programers have to write lots of code to fix these problems.

I think this paragraph almost completely explains *what happened* - It just doesn't address *all* of Uber's methodology behind the logic of handling this scenario:

>According to data obtained from the self-driving system, the system first registered radar and LIDAR observations of the pedestrian about 6 seconds before impact, when the vehicle was traveling at 43 mph. As the vehicle and pedestrian paths converged, the self-driving system software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, as a vehicle, and then as a bicycle with varying expectations of future travel path. At 1.3 seconds before impact, the self-driving system determined that an emergency braking maneuver was needed to mitigate a collision (see figure 2).[2]  According to Uber, emergency braking maneuvers are not enabled while the vehicle is under computer control, to reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior. The vehicle operator is relied on to intervene and take action. The system is not designed to alert the operator.

The core of what happened is that at 1.3 seconds before impact ""emergency braking maneuver was needed to mitigate a collision"" but such capabilities are disabled to ""reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior.""  So the car could have braked, but it was programmed not to do emergency braking.  IMO the situation implies that steady (de)acceleration (read:vehicle behavior) is more important than collision mitigation, and this prioritization or threshold is not currently acceptable to the local government and society because it is believed that a human would have attempted emergency braking under similar circumstances.",tech,t2_368ud,8todh7,e1bl305,/r/tech/comments/8todh7/tesla_autopilot_has_an_actual_mad_max_mode_in/e1bl305/,/r/tech/comments/8todh7/tesla_autopilot_has_an_actual_mad_max_mode_in/

1509,bobtehpanda,http://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/mass-transit/elon-musks-hyperloop-proposal-gains-momentum,"That's already done for high-speed rail in many countries. The main issue is curvature; a train going 300mph or a tube going 500mph is going to need a much wider curvature than a highway with a 70mph speed limit. The curve radius Elon Musk cites for a 300mph curve is 1 mile, at .5g. New Jersey's Interstate standards only specify a curve of 2040 ft for 70mph cars, which is less than half of what a hyperloop would need. So at curves it's more likely than not that a Hyperloop will need to diverge, and if tighter curves happen to exist in either mountainous or urban areas it will be even more expensive. There's also the issue of whether or not the I-5 right of way is wide enough for all this, particularly in urban or mountainous areas.

(I also think that Elon Musk's upper bound of .5g is a little high, given that that's the equivalent of a car going from 0-60mph in 6.5s. Trains can already expose passengers to that kind of g-force, but generally design for a maximum of 0.2-.3g to limit passenger discomfort.)",tech,t2_fu70d,3xhnzv,cy5zrla,/r/tech/comments/3xhnzv/elon_musks_hyperloop_proposal_gains_momentum/cy5zrla/,/r/tech/comments/3xhnzv/elon_musks_hyperloop_proposal_gains_momentum/

And the high weight of the train means you'd have to extra-reinforce any curves or turns in the track. 

With the hyperloop, you basically have 1/8th of the train as the normal load. Since it'll be individual cars that have their own individual propulsion. That means you don't need nearly as much support. And since you don't need heavy metal guide rails, that also shaves off a lot of weight.

Nowhere is it mentioned that anyone has done the opposite by selling the air rights to infrastructure and just continued using their land as normal, so unless an example is provided I'm going to assume it doesn't really work the other way around.

There is a second issue with the idea of building an elevated piece of infrastructure and leaving what's under it to be freely used by the property owner; constructing the elevated infrastructure itself is probably more expensive than just buying up the land and building it at grade level, with a few bridges here and there so that people can cross under it. Farmland is generally not that expensive, and if it were more expensive than building elevated infrastructure and the associated maintenance costs, we would be doing this for highways and rail already, but we don't.

Quoting this because inevitably you will delete it at some point.

Even if Tesla weren't solvent and so far in the red that they couldn't continue operations they would just file bankruptcy and be bought out by another (or existing) player. The brand has value even if Musk is removed from the equation and they certainly have the assets/infrastructure in place that make them a valuable market participant.

However that's very unlikely to happen barring some massive fuckups within Tesla, either on the development or engineering side. They're currently ramping up production of vehicles and more importantly setting up the grid infrastructure to handle EVs.

Musk is changing the face of transportation & energy, and in the future, telecommunications and space exploration in massive ways. And that's before we talk about whatever other crazy ideas he comes up with. He picked a fight in industries that few others would have touched, and many ridiculed, and still do, his attempts to even try. 

Branson owns/owned an airline, some cable and phone companies, etc. He didn't develop his own planes, nor telecomms infrastructure. He managed very successful companies that were in the right place at the right time. The risk was minimal. He's a guy who runs some businesses who likes to drunkenly touch other peoples' wives. 

Allen was in the right place at the right time and was important in founding Microsoft, whose achievements don't really need to be mentioned, but there hasn't been much else since then. Stratolaunch has been around since 2011. How many rockets have spacex launched in that time? A lot. None of what he's achieved comes close to what Musk has done.

I don't disagree, but some people really push things forward more than others. That's always been the case. Certain Inventors, political and business leaders can contribute well above others. Henry Ford, Otto Von Bismarck, even Hewlett and Packard all changed how things were done in ways greater than Jeff Hawkins, Branson, and Paul Allen. Even they don't come close to what Musk has done.

> I can't really think of anything Musk is doing that another person or company isn't making great contributions to as well. He is a great guy and he's doing great things but this cult of personality that surrounds him is borderline cringy

Really? Which other space company forced the price of sending something into space down to a fraction of what it used to cost? Even NASA with all its resources couldn't do that. The others can't even keep up, never mind force the price down lower.

Which car company forced others to change their view on cars to the point of revolution in changing their drivetrain? Henry Ford could be considered, but again he focused on just one Industry. If Tesla hadn't started to push it forward even fewer than the current pathetically small number of electric cars would be getting built by other manufacturers. 

Sorry, but if you can't see the changes he's forced onto the industries he's worked in then I don't really know what to say to you other than you're really not giving him the credit he deserves. That's not a cult, that's not fanboyism, it's a fair assessment.

You need to provide the sources and data you're using to justify you're reasoning. If we're both looking at the same data it should at least be obvious where your analysis (and mine) spills over into opinion as opposed to reasonable projection of the data itself.

It's not being a fanboy asking for you to back up your assertions.

>Read the financials and realize the party is over. 

What specifically are you looking at? Their stock price has been somewhat volatile the last 3 months (as compared with the previous year at least) while their [financials](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tsla/financials?query=income-statement) show them posting increasing operating costs (apparently due to production issues) putting them in the red - but again that appears to be mostly due to [investment in infrastructure](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cash-burn-building-the-future/) which has a net positive effect on their valuation.

If all you're looking at is operation numbers and posting increasing losses then I would agree that it looks like a problem, but where Tesla is investing its income (manufacturing capacity, infrastructure, and physical assets) mitigates that by quite a bit. The raw financial numbers don't capture that, nor are they supposed to, and it's a big reason why their valuation and stock price continues to stay fairly strong.

The end result is that what I said before still stands, even if they declare bankruptcy and toss Elon Musk out on his ass the Tesla brand and assets are worth enough that they'll be picked up by someone else and continued.

>Model S and X demand is flat.

It looks like [demand has been rising](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/02/22/tesla-inc-sees-surprising-demand-for-model-s-and-x.aspx) for both the S and X, where are you sourcing your information that demand is flat?

>Model 3 did not save the world or stop global warming.

It's too early in the life cycle of the Model 3 to be able to tell how successful it will be and whether it will be enough to keep Tesla afloat (and for how long). There's plenty of valid criticism that the 3 won't sell as well as Tesla hopes because it's competing with entry level luxury vehicles like BMW and Audi, but for the moment they have plenty of demand to fill.

>Tesla is a bad thing not a good thing.

>Let it die.

What? How would there be more and cheaper electric cars if Tesla didn't exist, that doesn't make any sense. How do you think Tesla should have done it? You can't start out as a new car company and target mass market right away, the best move has always been to target the small, expensive and high margin market first and go lower later.

1637,happyscrappy,https://la.curbed.com/2018/8/15/17697288/elon-musk-tunnel-dodger-stadium,"Well, the problem is Musk seems to reject the basic idea of moving a lot of people in one go. All his transit ideas revolve around swarms of pods instead of large vehicles. And maybe in some cases that makes sense. But when you are moving people between only two points (a stadium and a train station) it seems really odd.

Adding to the problem here is that there is only one tunnel. So that means in order to go both directions they will have to clear the tunnel. If the trip takes 4 minutes (as mentioned) then it will be 8 minutes between the time the last pod leaves here and the time that a pod arrives here with people from the other end. To minimize the effect of this ""turnaround time"" they will have to have a large number of pods available and then send a large number to the far end in a group, presumably filled with people. Then after the last of those leaves, 8 minutes later they will start returning, probably with people in them. This is the case even if they have no people needed to make the return trip, because they'll at least have to bring empty cars back so they can refill them and send more people.

If the cars are sent 30 seconds apart (and have 30 seconds turnaround, good luck with that) and the trip takes 4 minutes and the cars hold 8 people, then the throughput with only 1 car (the worst) would be 2 car trips every 9 minutes, or 13.333 cars per hour, 107 people per hour. A car would leave a given station every 9 minutes.

Obviously they would have more cars. If they have 10 cars then 10 cars leave every 9 minutes, and take 4.5 minutes to leave. So 10 cars every 13.5 minutes or 44.44 cars per hour, 355 people per hour. And if you arrive at a station it could be 13.5 minutes before you can leave on a car (17.5 to get there), even if there is no one in front of you. He says 1200 people per day, he can't be expecting to take 4 hours to move people to a ballgame, so he'll have more cars than that.

If he has 30 cars they would leave every 9 minutes and take 14.5 minutes to go, for 30 cars every 23.5 minutes. Now you are up to 76.6 cars per hour. Or 612 people per hour. But it could be 23.5 minutes before you can leave (27.5 to get there) even if there is no one ahead of you.

So I guess I'm guessing about 30 cars. Then it would take 2 hours to get the 1200 people to the park. This is unrealistic, but it's probably realistic enough to convince yourself it's okay.

50 cars every 9+24.5 minutes yields 89.5 cars per hour or 716 people per hour. Diminishing returns and you're really starting to make people wait, showing up and taking 33.5 minutes to get on a car and 37.5 to get there (when you were told the journey is 4) is kind of bogus.

Wow, the throughput on this thing is bad. I wonder how often Musk thinks a car would leave. Given these awful figures I just did I would guess he thinks it'll be less than 30 seconds between them. Or maybe more people per car. To be fair, at those speeds, 30 seconds is a mile apart!

If he think it would be (say) 15 seconds between the cars I wonder how he thinks he'll get 8 people out of a car and 8 more in in 15 seconds. I guess it'd have to be something like a ski gondola system where the cars are moving and multiple ones loading/unloading at once.

[edit: maybe there's a passing section (doubletrack) in the middle for cars to pass. That would make a huge difference by reducing the turn around time between going one way and going the other.

1670,happyscrappy,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-24/tesla-s-newest-promises-break-the-laws-of-batteries,"I ran some of the numbers myself when Tesla made the announcement.

Here are my answers:

For anything involving price, don't sweat it. Tesla routinely fails to make their promised prices. They'll do it again.

For the anything involving packs that seem like they aren't possible (like a big pack in a small roadster), the answer is they are expecting packs to become more energy and power dense in the future. They are far from the only EV company to try to wow you by announcing a vehicle that is years away and getting you to then compare it to existing technology in your head. Tesla did it with the Model 3. GM did it with the Bolt. Porsche did it with the Mission-E.

As to the power charging rates for the truck, I actually calculated it'll need at least a 1.6MW charger. This will probably mean the truck has a 2000V battery pack (4x their existing pack voltages) and it then they'll increase the current 3.3x also.

Is this possible? Yes. Is it feasible? I don't think so. The bad news is getting that much power into a charging station will be very difficult. The good news is that the places where it actually is possible are probably also near major highways. But I don't think putting those stations will solve the problems that companies like Wal-Mart will encounter.

Wal-Mart's issue will be trying to charge the trucks at their departure location and destination. You're not going to run just one truck on a route and trying to charge more than one of these at once is going to be difficult and expensive. Putting a charger of this sort into a warehouse will cost a lot but it could be made to work. Putting a charger of this sort into a store just isn't going to make any sense.

I'm sure Tesla will use local storage to cut the need to deliver peak power and to reduce demand charges. But that starts to fall apart when you are charging a lot of trucks in the same day. In the case where a charger is in use 50% of the time for a day the value in local storage is minimal.

This isn't to say I think this can't be done or can't be done cost-effectively. But a 5-truck pilot project (as Wal-Mart has ordered for use in the US) is going to be tough to make cost-effective.

And for the life of me I cannot figure why anyone would think the future of semi tractors is Tesla. Tesla has to start from the ground up. That's a lot harder than Peterbuilt or Mack or Volvo swapping their drivetrain out for an electric one. Those companies should have an advantage over Tesla. It'd be different if Tesla's truck were available today, but it isn't. With 3 years runway there's no reason Volvo can't bring an electric semi to market and create an easier choice for companies who want to use electric semis.",tech,t2_doey6au,7fadvh,dqb1gz2,/r/tech/comments/7fadvh/teslas_newest_promises_break_the_laws_of/dqb1gz2/,/r/tech/comments/7fadvh/teslas_newest_promises_break_the_laws_of/

Why would you need to use a line

Trucks have all sorts of special equipment built for them, because time is money and trucks are incredibly huge. Why not just drive over what would be a weigh station and clamp directly to a charge carrier. 

The ratings for amperage in wires provide fusing currents as well. For 0000 wire, fusing at 10s is 3.2kA in open air. But if you immerse that in dielectric coolant... then it could last arbitrarily long depending on the capacity of your cooling system. If you use some sort of bus bar, then you can lower the resistivity even further. Some combination of these can transmit whatever power rating you need, claiming it's not possible is a bit silly.

Two reasons:

1. Weigh stations are government owned, and often don't allow overnight parking. I doubt that they will want to foot the bill, or clog their precious inspection lanes with charging trucks. 

2. My company and I have an excellent combined CSA score and 9/10 I get a bypass signal. I'm not going into a weigh station if I don't have to, I might get inspected and they might find something I missed and fine the hell out of me.

If your about to suggest truckstops, don't. The truckstop corporations are frightened by SDTs and this has caused a parking apocalypse. Love's has plans in their site on how they can convert truck stops into mini-storage.

Diesel-electric would work until these infrastructure concerns are met. The same size motor that runs my truck runs the generator at the nursing home I worked at. I'm sure that if it's started to intermittently charge the battery pack, your still looking at less pollution.

The government limits how heavy a truck can be without a permit. A weigh station is ran by the state police, and it's used to do two things: weigh trucks and do inspections.

They don't weigh and inspect trucks as a service or whatever, they do it to write tickets. The same kind of ticket you would get for a speeding violation. It's a state government revenue source. It's literally a place where they try to catch you breaking the law to cite you. It's not the kind of place you want to stick around in.

Now if you mean scales like CAT scales like the have at truck stops to check that your weight is legal, it only takes about 45 seconds to get a weight. I doubt that would be long enough to get a usable charge.

1762,Nakotadinzeo,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-24/tesla-s-newest-promises-break-the-laws-of-batteries,"[Most trucks have a built in scale now](https://i.imgur.com/FRErdG2.jpg)that shows what the truck's rear axle is under.

But even if we make inductive parking spots or some kind of cradle system, there's a problem getting to them.

Here's an (admittedly unscientific) experiment. Go to your nearest truck stop at 10 Pm and pretend your a driver looking for a spot. You won't find one. Now imagine there are 4 charging docks, and your batteries are nearly depleted.

We have current infrastructure problems that electric only would exaserbate. We need a bridging solution to show private industry that there's profit in adding electrical charging and expansion, while ensuring that the truck can meet the high demand of logistics without going dead.

Diesel-electric could make that niche. Diesel engines have a sweet spot where they use little fuel, but generate lots of power. Using the diesel engine as propulsion ignores that, but setting the engine at that speed to generate electrical power that charges the battery banks and shuts off. As diesel pumps are displayed, the size of the generator can shrink until an EPU sized generator is all that's left.

I'm not trying to shit on this, it's just that I live this life. These trucks get pushed really hard, and things break all the time. If u were in a Tesla truck, I would be constantly in fear of something breaking. Unlike cars, semi's have a lot of interchangeable parts that are brand egoistic. This makes repairs easier, but the Tesla won't have that advantage.

Tesla should buy an existing truck company I think. It adds service centers to the mix, and Tesla cars could be serviced their too.

I once read an article about the Tobacco industry and how they profited from legislation restricting or prohibiting their marketing programs. The only reason they spent money on it in the first place is because their competitors did, but if no one spends the money people still buy cigarettes. So in the end they had more money because of it.

There is also the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty between the UDSSR and the USA. Basically they voluntarily accepted restrictions on defence systems against nuclear missiles. This was both because development of such systems would threaten the MAD (mutually assured destruction) principle and because it saved both governments a shit-ton of money, both in offensive and defensiv weaponry.

Now, I'm not sure those arguments make sense in this context and if we ever get into a hot global conflict all bets are off anyway.

Australia Tax is a phrase applied to the generally higher prices in Australia of goods and services than equivalent costs in comparative overseas nations such as the United States of America. This is particularly the case for video games, computer hardware, and software but may extend to non-technological items such as cars, designer clothing and banking services. Companies selling non-physical products which are not subject to the rent and labour of a traditional retail outlet have been particularly criticised. Some prices differences can be as much as 88%.

Source this please. We're talking about accidents where the life saving properties are most useful as well. I feel like the small overlap front crash is pretty common really, especially as:

> He [David Zuby, chief research officer at IIHS] estimates that the test represents about 25 percent of frontal collisions that seriously injure or kill someone.

And lets not forget Tesla's response:

> IIHS and dozens of other private industry groups around the world have methods and motivations that suit their own subjective purpose

Which is just a plain irresponsible statement. It's pretty much trying to claim their test is invalid or not useful.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) is a U.S. nonprofit organization funded by auto insurers, established in 1959 and headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. It works to reduce the number of motor vehicle crashes, and the rate of injuries and amount of property damage in the crashes that still occur. It carries out research and produces ratings for popular passenger vehicles as well as for certain consumer products such as child car booster seats. It also conducts research on road design and traffic regulations, and has been involved in promoting policy decisions.

It will easily be able to detect any kind of wheelspin, and it can tell when it is a blizzard, but in the winter, some roads can be pretty bad, whereas others can be great, sometime after a snowfall. 

It could maybe use weather information, or there could be a road conditions database that gets updated somewhere. 

The cars will be far superior once there are a lot of them.on the road communicating with HQ. 

At that point, they could send wheel slip information or anything else to HQ, and the cars will all know that there is a single patch of ice at location x. 

But I think that level of sophistication is a while away still. It would need a lot of cars for one, a lot of cheap bandwidth for another, and a sophisticated programming. 

It would be kind of like Batman's cellphone network in Dark Knight. But it's own data would be a bit more immediate. Direct communication between cars would be faster as well.

This isn't as common as you might think. In the US, at least, the majority of motorcycle deaths occur in multiple-vehicle accidents. The vast majority of *those* were caused by other vehicles failing to yield the right-of-way while making a left turn, thereby striking the motorcyclist, making that specific type of accident the most deadly scenario to motorcyclists.

About 70% of single-vehicle motorcycle accidents [involve a BAC of over 0.08](http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/motorcycles/fatalityfacts/motorcycles#Alcohol-involvement).

Somehow you managed to miss my point. Did you read the article? Are you paying attention?

They're going to announce self-driving. Thus the question of what would the car do if allowed to drive itself without supervision comes up. Can it function alone? If it's accelerating into barriers then there is a question as to whether it can function alone.

Yes, that driver used his car in a way that is not recommended. But we have to look at the underlying behavior. The car clearly did something we wouldn't want a self-driving car to do.

> Especially when it will automatically slow down to a stop if it detects the driver doesnt have their hands on the wheel.

You're funny. Did you know Tesla claimed that for a year when it wasn't even true? Now that it is true, the driver has to not pay attention for many minutes (over 5, IIRC) before it pulls slows down.

No. I'm not. when one of their vehicles clearly cannot see a dangerous situation despite that it is supposed to do so (even if it should not be relied upon to do so) validly raises the concern of what happens when the car is supposed to operate on its own and doesn't see dangerous situations it is supposed to see?

> The fact is the driver bet on the car assessing a situation as dangerous when it is in no way shape or form designed for that in any capacity whatsoever. That's why driver participation is still required.

Yes, the driver is supposed to supervise the car. I said so myself. But it's also not designed to accelerate into barriers. And yet it did. This leads to the question as to whether their follow-on system can self-drive with no supervision or if it's going to do things it isn't supposed to do leading to big problems because the driver is not required to supervise this system.

The number of required connections to actually augment our brains with anything useful if pretty significant. It will be of value to people who have peripheral nerve damage of some sort, as that is a manageable number. But I don't think we'll be downloading our brains within 50 years, if ever. 

A ""lace"" that didn't require removing your skull for surgery would need millions of nano bots that move and distribute themselves over the surface and folds of the brain. They would need a power source (maybe glucose, but RF might end up being more practical), and they would have to radio the information to an external receiver. This receiver would be a cap in the beginning (which would also provide the RF power), but possibly the nodes could self-organize to pass on data from adjacent nodes in the direction of a small receiver, possibly at the base of the skull. And these wouldn't have access to the inner structures of the brain, which would block the extreme high frequency radio signals these bots would only be able to put out due to their extreme small size. 

To be small enough, these bots would have to be molecular computers, which is why I don't see this happening for many decades. I'm not even confident molecular computers would be small enough.

Getting information back out is a little more annoying since we can't control our brains like we can control computers, but fortunately it's a lot easier to do than getting information in.

I do agree with you about maybe requiring nanobots or something noninvasive to create a brain-computer interface. However, in terms of size, I don't think that they would have to molecular computers. The neurons in the brain are much larger than molecules so I imagine that neuron nanobots would mimic cellular structures and have some sort of binary data store that creates artificial proteins that prompt some mechanistic reaction in their internal components. I guess that would have to be relatively small in order to avoid disrupting existing brain structure but they could inhabit the cerebral cavity surrounding your brain relatively easy. There is the issue of the blood brain barrier I guess but I'm not exactly sure about the mechanistic properties of that so who knows how that would be solved.

2196,fleshrott,https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/03/elon-musk-is-setting-up-a-company-that-will-link-brains-and-computers/,"I was thinking more about this.

Let's say we have this mind backup tech worked out.  So each day you diligently make a backup.  There's original-meat-you, and digital-backup-you.  If one day you're hit by a bus then in terms of continuity original-meat-you is, well, dead.  His continuity is over.  The digital-backup-you is then popped into a new body at the local Clone and Drone (they do meat or robots, why not) and becoming new-meat-you.  From new-meat-you the continuity is that he went to sleep in one body and woke up in a new one, but from his perspective it's no different than a bus accident hospitalizing him and causing a few hours of memory loss (original-meat's time after backup).

If someone asked new-meat-you if he was the same person, he's probably say yes, or he'd say he doesn't feel any different, or he's say it doesn't matter.

An analogy would be an mp3 file, say Parabola by Tool.  If you move the file to some other part of the hard drive, all that changes is a bit of header information, it's still the same file.  If you move it to another drive however all the data has to be created and the original deleted.  It's still the same file though isn't it?  I mean you moved it.  Anyone I've talked to about moving files has used language that suggests they believe it's the same file.  If you copy it manually and then delete the original you've done the same thing as the computer would've done behind the scenes.  When I listen to Parabola it sounds the same.  There's still only one Parabola.  The semantics of it don't really matter much.

2232,Samtheism,https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux,"For anyone unable to access:

The first master plan that I wrote 10 years ago is now in the final stages of completion. It wasn't all that complicated and basically consisted of:  
1.Create a low volume car, which would necessarily be expensive  
2.Use that money to develop a medium volume car at a lower price  
3.Use that money to create an affordable, high volume car  

And...  

4.Provide solar power. No kidding, this has literally been on our website for 10 years.  

The reason we had to start off with step 1 was that it was all I could afford to do with what I made from PayPal. I thought our chances of success were so low that I didn't want to risk anyone's funds in the beginning but my own. The list of successful car company startups is short. As of 2016, the number of American car companies that haven't gone bankrupt is a grand total of two: Ford and Tesla. Starting a car company is idiotic and an electric car company is idiocy squared.  

Also, a low volume car means a much smaller, simpler factory, albeit with most things done by hand. Without economies of scale, anything we built would be expensive, whether it was an economy sedan or a sports car. While at least some people would be prepared to pay a high price for a sports car, no one was going to pay $100k for an electric Honda Civic, no matter how cool it looked.  

Part of the reason I wrote the first master plan was to defend against the inevitable attacks Tesla would face accusing us of just caring about making cars for rich people, implying that we felt there was a shortage of sports car companies or some other bizarre rationale. Unfortunately, the blog didn't stop countless attack articles on exactly these grounds, so it pretty much completely failed that objective.  

However, the main reason was to explain how our actions fit into a larger picture, so that they would seem less random. The point of all this was, and remains, accelerating the advent of sustainable energy, so that we can imagine far into the future and life is still good. That's what ""sustainable"" means. It's not some silly, hippy thing -- it matters for everyone.  

By definition, we must at some point achieve a sustainable energy economy or we will run out of fossil fuels to burn and civilization will collapse. Given that we must get off fossil fuels anyway and that virtually all scientists agree that dramatically increasing atmospheric and oceanic carbon levels is insane, the faster we achieve sustainability, the better.  

Here is what we plan to do to make that day come sooner:  

**Integrate Energy Generation and Storage**  
Create a smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product that just works, empowering the individual as their own utility, and then scale that throughout the world. One ordering experience, one installation, one service contact, one phone app.  

We can't do this well if Tesla and SolarCity are different companies, which is why we need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies. That they are separate at all, despite similar origins and pursuit of the same overarching goal of sustainable energy, is largely an accident of history. Now that Tesla is ready to scale Powerwall and SolarCity is ready to provide highly differentiated solar, the time has come to bring them together.  

**Expand to Cover the Major Forms of Terrestrial Transport**  
Today, Tesla addresses two relatively small segments of premium sedans and SUVs. With the Model 3, a future compact SUV and a new kind of pickup truck, we plan to address most of the consumer market. A lower cost vehicle than the Model 3 is unlikely to be necessary, because of the third part of the plan described below.  

What really matters to accelerate a sustainable future is being able to scale up production volume as quickly as possible. That is why Tesla engineering has transitioned to focus heavily on designing the machine that makes the machine -- turning the factory itself into a product. A first principles physics analysis of automotive production suggests that somewhere between a 5 to 10 fold improvement is achievable by version 3 on a roughly 2 year iteration cycle. The first Model 3 factory machine should be thought of as version 0.5, with version 1.0 probably in 2018.  

In addition to consumer vehicles, there are two other types of electric vehicle needed: heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport. Both are in the early stages of development at Tesla and should be ready for unveiling next year. We believe the Tesla Semi will deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport, while increasing safety and making it really fun to operate.  

With the advent of autonomy, it will probably make sense to shrink the size of buses and transition the role of bus driver to that of fleet manager. Traffic congestion would improve due to increased passenger areal density by eliminating the center aisle and putting seats where there are currently entryways, and matching acceleration and braking to other vehicles, thus avoiding the inertial impedance to smooth traffic flow of traditional heavy buses. It would also take people all the way to their destination. Fixed summon buttons at existing bus stops would serve those who don't have a phone. Design accommodates wheelchairs, strollers and bikes.  

**Autonomy**  
As the technology matures, all Tesla vehicles will have the hardware necessary to be fully self-driving with fail-operational capability, meaning that any given system in the car could break and your car will still drive itself safely. It is important to emphasize that refinement and validation of the software will take much longer than putting in place the cameras, radar, sonar and computing hardware.  

Even once the software is highly refined and far better than the average human driver, there will still be a significant time gap, varying widely by jurisdiction, before true self-driving is approved by regulators. We expect that worldwide regulatory approval will require something on the order of 6 billion miles (10 billion km). Current fleet learning is happening at just over 3 million miles (5 million km) per day.  

I should add a note here to explain why Tesla is deploying partial autonomy now, rather than waiting until some point in the future. The most important reason is that, when used correctly, it is already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves and it would therefore be morally reprehensible to delay release simply for fear of bad press or some mercantile calculation of legal liability.  

According to the recently released 2015 NHTSA report, automotive fatalities increased by 8% to one death every 89 million miles. Autopilot miles will soon exceed twice that number and the system gets better every day. It would no more make sense to disable Tesla's Autopilot, as some have called for, than it would to disable autopilot in aircraft, after which our system is named.  

It is also important to explain why we refer to Autopilot as ""beta"". This is not beta software in any normal sense of the word. Every release goes through extensive internal validation before it reaches any customers. It is called beta in order to decrease complacency and indicate that it will continue to improve (Autopilot is always off by default). Once we get to the point where Autopilot is approximately 10 times safer than the US vehicle average, the beta label will be removed.  

**Sharing**  
When true self-driving is approved by regulators, it will mean that you will be able to summon your Tesla from pretty much anywhere. Once it picks you up, you will be able to sleep, read or do anything else enroute to your destination.  

You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost. This dramatically lowers the true cost of ownership to the point where almost anyone could own a Tesla. Since most cars are only in use by their owner for 5% to 10% of the day, the fundamental economic utility of a true self-driving car is likely to be several times that of a car which is not.  

In cities where demand exceeds the supply of customer-owned cars, Tesla will operate its own fleet, ensuring you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you are.  

**So, in short, Master Plan, Part Deux is:**  

Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage  
 Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments  
 Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning  
 Enable your car to make money for you when you aren't using it

If you don't have that, then the roads will be half full of empty cars being summoned for people. 

I personally think that most cars will just become public, with a similar rating. It's much more convenient, if you can just be anywhere, and hop in the nearest car that best suits how many people you are, and what sort of baggage you have to bring with you, and all that. You could pay more for classier cars at your disposal, or what have you, also. 

The only downside, is you can't just leave stuff in your car for when you might need it. For that, you need your own car.

This actually wouldn't be a problem. I've seen some estimates that our current road infrastructure could support 4x the volume of automated cars without causing increased congestion. That is how much more efficient they would be over human drivers. Even if you assumed that empty cars on the way to a pick-up increased traffic volume 2x, the roads would actually be less congested than they are now due to the efficiency of automation.

That of course assumes 100% of the road population is automated. There will probably be a somewhat uncomfortable conversion period of a few decades where automated cars mix with human driven ones and we still have crappy traffic caused by human drivers.

2300,BaronVonCrunch,https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux,"GM is actually investing in Lyft *and* starting their own ride-sharing service (Maven). 

As Musk describes in this post, it's pretty likely that autonomous vehicles will undermine car ownership. While many people will still buy their own car, simply having always-available rides will mean a lot of people wont need to own their own car at all. If that happens, it's going to suck to be high-volume auto manufacturers. 

So GM is placing a on expensive bet with Lyft, in case it turns out that ride-sharing companies are the future. That will allow GM to have a guaranteed spot in that market, and the ability to sell a lot of its own cars to a dominant ride-sharing company. 

But really, GM doesn't want to turn into a supplier. GM wants to be the retail provider. If GM can't make money selling the car to the customer, then GM wants to make money from selling car *access* to the customer. That lets GM match production more closely to demand, make money over the whole lifetime of the car and maintain some degree of control over prices. 

It's an interesting bet, but it is also a risky one. By going halfway with both plays, GM may just find itself a second-rate player no matter how the market develops.

A self-driving car doesn't have to be perfect.  It doesn't need to avoid every accident.  It doesn't even need to avoid every accident that it could cause itself.

A self-driving car needs to be a little better than a sober teenager to almost immediately start saving lives.

A self-driving car that's as good as an adult who maybe isn't very good at driving but can stay in their lane, signal appropriately, and isn't trying to send texts while they drive is going to be scarily better than many of the people on the road.

And it will probably be a _lot_ easier to convince a grandmother who wants to be mobile damnit to get a self driving car than it is to convince her to stop driving otherwise.  And that will help safety a lot.

This has already been the case for years.  The hurdle now is realising that humans are masters of pattern recognition and will quickly learn how to bully and exploit self-driving cars programming once they become more widespread.

There is also the problem that sometimes a human driver adds value to a vehicle.  An obvious example is a truck driver being able to unload what they're hauling.  The other problem is there are not that many low-skill jobs to absorb drivers into, and governments will have an interest in subsidising the use of professional human drivers to keep people working, as it's more efficient than putting an unemployed person on welfare, further cutting into the competitive advantage of self-driving cars.

Driverless cars already are in use in the context of stuff like trucks on private roads in places where hiring drivers is very expensive E.G. oilfields.  

What I'm very excited to think about is I can only see self-driving cars driving themselves, which I think will be the true revolution.  It will make car-share services into cheaper taxicab services as the car can drive itself to where it is needed afterwards.  It will enable self-valet allowing for shorter trips and more available parking.  It will obviously allow the replacement of professional drivers.  I don't believe self-driving cars will be that much of a hit with somebody still behind the wheel because while it will be safer, I have doubts as to how much of a selling point that will be.",tech,t2_884o7,6sxrlc,dlkl5ek,/r/tech/comments/6sxrlc/elon_musk_is_right_driverless_cars_will_arrive_by/dlkl5ek/,/r/tech/comments/6sxrlc/elon_musk_is_right_driverless_cars_will_arrive_by/

The reality is they can't release these things until they're practically perfect. Software, in practice, doesn't make ""mistakes,"" it does what it was designed to do and if there's a problem it's because it wasn't designed well enough. You've now inserted blame into an equation that is otherwise (barring abject negligence) universally accepted by society as a forgivable accident--being a bad driver.

a 50% reduction in accidents is pretty significant. that means there are 20-25k people who won't die every year because of traffic accidents from the first year it is implemented to forever. that means that insurance companies are only paying out half of what they currently are, which means everyone rates drop (hypothetically - i am sure they will just add a ""driverless car charge"" to increase them, even though their costs would go down..). that means 50% less traffic jams caused by accidents. and every accident would be a learning experience for the software, which would reduce the chances of or completely prevent that type of accident from occurring again. meaning that if it is a 50% reduction on day 1, after say 5 years it would be a 75% reduction, after 10 years a 99% reduction. it would put car fatalities into the same ballpark as air traffic fatalities - basically the only time an accident occurs would be tampering, road debris, or mechanical failure. which any of those can cause accidents today..

not to mention i think the real reduction out of the gate would be much greater than 50%...all the accidents involving driverless cars i have heard about have had a human driver who was at fault. and when all cars are driverless, it will increase the overall efficiency of driving - fewer accidents mean fewer delays. there won't be someone doing 10 under on the highway, or someone trying to do 30 over and swerving through traffic, all the cars will be doing the same speed limit. brake heavy people won't be able to cause a brake cascades and create ghost-traffic jams. driverless cars could hypothetically communicate and setup ""drafting"" chains (because without the human factor, this would be immensely safer) increasing fuel efficiency by vast margins. 

the only downsides are the morals of emergency case scenarios - when the car software has to decide which party to potentially kill (occupants, pedestrians, other vehicle), which the simple solution is to do what people do naturally, which would be self preservation. and then people who are saying ""but I AM A GREAT DRIVER I NEVER CAUSE ISSUES I DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP MY LICENSE"". i am a good driver, i have been in 0 at fault accidents for my driving career over the last 17 years. but i also am self aware to know that i am somewhat lucky - there have been a few times that i can recall where i had a lapse in judgement or attention and very easily could (or should) have caused an accident, but someone else was luckily paying attention and able to compensate, or i was just lucky there wasn't anyone else in that part of the road. and i am sure for every time i can remember there were 5 times that i wasn't even aware of being lucky that day - all it takes is you blinking at just the wrong moment and that .1 seconds added to your reaction time to a changing situation can mean the difference between you making it home that night or ending up in the hospital or dead. a self driving car will never have to blink, there are no opportunities for a distraction or a natural body function to cause an accident. i mean shit, yesterday 5 miles from my house some guy had a heart attack at the wheel and lost control of his car, went across the median at speed and hit another car head on. he died and put 2 innocent people in the hospital, which last i heard they were in critical condition. had he been in a self driving car that accident doesn't happen (he may have still died from the heart attack though, hard to say. but his poor health wouldn't have irrevocably changed or ended the lives of 2 strangers)",tech,t2_884o7,6sxrlc,dlh2pnl,/r/tech/comments/6sxrlc/elon_musk_is_right_driverless_cars_will_arrive_by/dlh2pnl/,/r/tech/comments/6sxrlc/elon_musk_is_right_driverless_cars_will_arrive_by/

It's when it does it a second time for what people see as the same case.  Then it goes from an accident to negligence, and the real dollar amounts will start to move around.",tech,t2_884o7,6sxrlc,dlhqv29,/r/tech/comments/6sxrlc/elon_musk_is_right_driverless_cars_will_arrive_by/dlhqv29/,/r/tech/comments/6sxrlc/elon_musk_is_right_driverless_cars_will_arrive_by/

We're talking cars selling third hand for anywhere between $2k and zero, with 100k miles or more; which means a Model 3 selling today at $43k (self-drive option included) will be 8-10 years down the line before it even touches that market. Plus there's the problem of a battery reconditioning: that's probably going to double the price to $4k and is non-optional since an EV with 250 miles range is reasonable; one with 100 miles range is not worth it at all; this will further hinder secondary and tertiary market penetration of Tesla-style EVs. 

Short takeaway: EVs and high tech vehicles are great if you're middle class. If you're poor, they're not even on the horizon. Petrol will dominate because it has small, incremental running costs and acceptable performance even at the poor maintenance end; EVs structurally don't have that.

Insurance costs will very quickly drive up the costs of non autonomous vehicles to more than its affordable for most people. As those costs rise, driverless car fleets will be brought online that will be offered to public as a service, you pay a certain amount a week or a year and the car will arrive and bring you to your destination before going to another customer. Those services will start to become cheaper than the insurance costs to insure and old human driven car.

Here's how I see it happening after the initial 6 months or so

1. Autonomous cars will get insanely cheap insurance quotes, next to nothing
2. Car rental services will start to offer an autonomous car service where you request a car and it will arrive at your location within X minutes. Probably limited to certain cities or regions initially 
3. After a while, human driven cars will start getting an additional premium on their insurance, since they're responsible for an overwhelming majority of accidents 
4. Older used car sales will start to dry up, they're considered so unsafe by insurers that they're not worth buying because the insurance will cost more than a newer car (with more safety features) would cost
5. More and more people will sign up to the autonomous car services, peak times still experience large delays if you haven't paid extra to book a car in advance 
6. Costs of using the autonomous car service start to become cheaper than buying and maintaining new cars
7. Once a certain threshold of autonomous cars vs human driven cars is reached, insurers will put the hydraulics under human driven cars without some form of automation. Driving a car on public roads become unaffordable to average people. 
8. Roads will start to be redesigned to accommodate the ever increasing amount of autonomously cars, express lanes, junction signals, right of way and minimum distances between cars will all be tailored to suit autonomous vehicles. 
9. Entire sections of towns and cities will be declared autonomous vehicles only
10. An entire city or country will announce its going entirely autonomous, entire networks of roads will be redesigned and new rules of the road will be designed which will reduce the amount of traffic and journey times which will increase efficiency of autonomous car services 
11. Personally owning an autonomous car will be seen as a waste of money for all but the very few. Will be comparable to owning your own plane. 

I could see all this happening within 10 years of mass autonomous car production. Obviously when we hit 'mass autonomous car production' is massively subjective and it will be most likely be country specific, but I suspect we'll see a similar pattern all over.

The arrival of mass-scale self-driving vehicles is likely to drastically dent car ownership. While some people will insist on leaving stuff in their cars, for a lot of people 1) a second car gets used rarely, and will get dropped ASAP. Some will rush to sell theirs; some will just not replace theirs as they get older. 2) having a guaranteed latency and a guaranteed ""door to door"" service for distances that are not practical in a car will make all the difference.

E.g. for me, if I can be guaranteed a car will be here in 5 minutes,  and take me to the station it is ""good enough"". If I can enter my *endpoint*, and a car comes and picks me up and *tells me which station is most efficient, and which platform to go to* and drives me there, followed by another car picking me up at the designated target station and driving me to where I wanted to go would be far superior to both a car and public transport in isolation.

Nearly the moment self driving fleets become available, car sales will likely crater, not least because the used car market will get flooded by nearly-new models as people want to switch. It may still take a while, but I don't think car ownership will ever recover.

I'm less convinced about that 'lots of very safe drivers' thing than you are. :)

The other part is that you have different _kinds_ of failures for a self-driving car.

With a human, you have people that speed, people that don't take into account the actual road conditions, don't slow down for blind curves, that get distracted, and who fall asleep.

With a self-driving car, you have it tracking the wrong lines on the road and moving into other lanes.  You have it failing to see an obstruction on the road because it doesn't fit anything it knows to look for, and driving into it.

And you definitely have problems with construction and emergency situations.

But for a large number of cases, an absolutely acceptable response is to make noise at the passengers of the car while pulling off to the side of the road and stopping.

You don't want to just come to a stop in the middle of the highway, but you may want to pull over and stop.

Maybe it started coming down rain or snow so hard that it can't see the lines on the road anymore.  A human driver might guess where the lines are based on what the other cars are doing and try to go on, or it might decide to pull over and wait.   A self-driving car should probably pull over. (Yeah, I've been both the one making guesses on where the lanes are, and the one who pulled over.)

The question wasn't 'is this safe' or 'is this the fault of the car', it was 'what happens when we get in the uncanny valley of automation where people stop paying attention to the road because the car is 'good enough?''.

And the answer is that we are _already_ at the point where people driving _believe_ that the car is good enough, even though it very, very clearly isn't.  Is screaming that it's not, and is asking the driver to please take control already.

People keep talking about how cars have to be perfect for people to trust them...  No, they really don't.  The car can be screaming that the human needs to take the wheel and the people are going to get killed because they trust the car to do the right thing.

By analogy: the separate-pool situation is akin to the US healthcare market pre-Obamacare.

Some of it you'll be able to do dynamically. E.g. you're driving West, someone else is taking a shorter journey East. If you're continuing West, then they might simply not return the other car, but let it fill the ""empty slot"" left by your long journey.

Of course many of these things will only be possible for major providers, but they ought to provide enough competitive advantage that the cost of renting such a car *ought to* drop below the cost of owning one even if you quite regularly take one out for a whole day. Think of it as timeshare - there are certain costs to being guaranteed near immediate access: if so the rental company need to have enough for the busiest day of they year. But for many it will be enough to be guaranteed 30m but usually less for example, in which case the rental company can charge less. Or with e.g. options to be ""shunted onto"" shared mibuses at busy times for example, if you want to save more money.

With a normal taxi service, salaries and medallions is a huge part of the cost. With self-driving cars the cost is buying and maintaining the cars.

2566,hexapodium,https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/08/10/elon-musk-is-right-driverless-cars-will-arrive-by-2021/,">I think the most obvious answer is, unfortunately, ubiquitous surveillance. With all of the sensors and cameras these cars will undoubtedly have, they're going to be pretty poor targets for all but the most sophisticated or desperate criminals. 

Possibly, but a quick attack scenario:

1. Buy a cloned CC ($10 or so); buy ten, because quite possibly some sort of algo ""we need to verify you"" phase kicks in if the card is for a new customer or a new area of order. 

2. Submit orders until you get a hit. Getting new IPs to submit orders from is easy because they're all NAT'd mobile phones anyway. 

3. Send the car somewhere fairly quiet. This can even be a quiet residential street, because

4. When it arrives, a guy in a balaclava or a hoodie walks up to it and snips the (mandatory, because fire and rescue) HV isolating link, then the LV isolator as well because they are often located in the same place. The car loses most power promptly. 

5. Roll it up into a panel van you've lined with aluminised insulating board (budget Faraday cage), with the help of two more guys who were in the van. No GPS. For good measure run a GPS and cell jammer inside the van body. Total time since the car arrived, 3-4 minutes (i.e. nowhere near enough to get cops to a nonviolent property crime) 

6. At your leisure, pull the rest of the car apart and disable any remaining LoJack style stuff

7. Treat it like a regular chop. 

Total excess money required compared to a regular steal-to-order op: a few thousand dollars, mostly on an old panel van. In fact, this is exactly the sort of operation a steal to order crew might get into as it's more opportunistic and lower risk. 

It's important to remember that successful criminals are by definition sophisticated and running a business. The autonomous car boom will present lots of easy opportunities to take the single highest risk in sentencing (the human you have to beat up to take their car) out of the picture, and also to entrap targets more efficiently through centralisation and automatic dispatch.

So now there are fewer people paying for insurance and not needing it, subsidising those who eventually make a claim. The insurer *must* cover their liabilities, but now with fewer policyholders the danger of liabilities exceeding their premium income rises; so rather than most policies cross-subsidising each other, the insurer has to reinsure more conservatively against lots of manual driver claims, since there is less slack in the insurer's accounts. That cost ultimately has to be borne by the policyholder. In short the extremely low premiums that autonomous driving should attract ultimately reduce the slack in the insurance market, and more must be found to cushion against unexpectedly high claim rates; that will come partly from reinsurance and partly from premiums.

And of course requiring a valid license introduces lots of friction into deployment, you have much higher exposure to being a vector for ID theft not just a third-party victim, it cuts your potential customer pool. For the US you have the additional problem that there's no standard and now you have to deal with 60-ish (50 states, DC, overseas territories, military issue) distinct licenses, all valid but some vastly easier to fake up than others - while REAL ID is pretty bad as legislation, it's a great barometer of how horribly tangled the US system is where a majority of states can't even agree on what information goes on a DL, let alone the form it should take and a baseline standard for verification. All this is the sort of thing that really has to be in place to go from ""nice idea, $10m experiment"" to ""next Uber, $100bn behemoth"" - and dealing with it is obviously expensive, slow, unavoidably regulated, etc - all things that the current startup situation doesn't handle well, and which might lead to market exit (or just no entry in the first place). 

I'll also point out that a ""complete"" ID with valid CC, government ID details, SSN, etc etc still costs less than $100 - requiring that sort of data ups the barrier to theft/hijacking a little, but when your payoff is in the high four/low five figure region it's not a huge barrier. Probably the realistic barrier will be the first creative prosecution that dings the perpetrators (who will have had to have gotten lazy, because trick one is that knocking over an autonomous car leaves no witnesses and no concrete evidence) for grand theft, fraud, wire fraud, probably kicks it up to federal level on an overbroad interstate commerce interpretation, identity theft, handling stolen property, and a few others - basically enough to get the sentence up to the equivalent of grand theft and assault, both with use-of-firearm riders (of which the assault and the firearms bits are the big ticket sentences; grand theft un-embellished, as a property crime, is a few years)",tech,t2_884o7,6sxrlc,dlhkhvx,/r/tech/comments/6sxrlc/elon_musk_is_right_driverless_cars_will_arrive_by/dlhkhvx/,/r/tech/comments/6sxrlc/elon_musk_is_right_driverless_cars_will_arrive_by/

in this context, ""semi"" refers to the type of trailer most associated with the big diesel tractors (trucks) that we all call semis. a semi-trailer is the kind of trailer that has only one set of axles or wheels (usually at the rear of the semi-trailer) and relies on the tractor to bear it's share of the weight of the load. 

by comparison, a full trailer has it's own set of axles/wheels at the front and the back of the trailer (like a pup trailer). in this case, the tractor (truck) merely pulls a full trailer and does not support its weight.

it should be called tesla tractor. or tesla heavy truck. anything except for tesla semi unless they're developing battery operated semi-trailers.

Currently a semi is going to get maybe 6mpg. A diesel Jaguar XF gets like 50mpg on the motorway.

So that's a difference of over 8 times. A Tesla is meant to have a range of 315 miles, so the same battery for a truck is going to get ~38 miles.

So to get that 2000 miles range we currently have (according to /u/Cronus6, I have done no fact checking on that) we'll need the equivalent of 52 batteries.

The battery pack on the Tesla is pretty huge, and weighs 544 kg! So we need 28,000kg of just battery to power a semi. That says nothing about the space requirement either. You'd need an entire trailer just to carry the battery packs.

You can only pull so much weight down the road, DOT mandates this.  Every pound you eat up moving a battery is a pound of cargo you can't haul.  That's pound of dead weight that isn't making you any money.

If /u/Pluckerpluck is even close to the 28,000kg of battery estimate... well that's almost 68,000 lbs.  You're limited to 80,000 in the trailer in most places.

There just isn't any getting around the fact that petroleum is a very dense fuel.  Now you could have a semi that doesn't have the 1800-2000 mile range we have floating around today.

Once we have fully self driving cars, there will need to be changes in laws in order for them to become that game changer.

With ABS brakes, you have a feature that was increasing the cost of a car, but the value proposition to consumers was that it would help them brake more safely...

First once they are proven safer, insurance will change enough that the self driving cars cost the same monthly as a new non-self driving.  (Making numbers up for illustration: new self drving $600/month + $50 insurance, manual driving, $350 month + $300 insurance). 

Then you'll have targeted age groups moving to self driving.  Seniors will be forced to, or rather given the option. Because what's better?  Self driving or not driving at all.  (Especially needed in Florida.  Years ago my grandfather, legally blind in one eye, 82 years old, they send him a 6 year renewal of drivers license in the mail)

Then you'll start to see certain roads, like interstates be self driving only.  The upside is that the speed limit will be higher.    Maybe it'll start as lanes like HOV Lanes.

Not right away certainly. But it will happen. 

Let's presume that the self-driving cars live up to the promise of faster, safer, and more efficient transport. There will be a tipping point where insuring a manual drive car will become prohibitively expensive. AVs will be orders of magnitude safer to operate at some future point. And when they begin to outnumber manual vehicles the insurance companies will start to modify their rates. I think that the ""ban"" will be gradual. Starting with highways and then moving down the scale.

> But there will always be car collectors driving their classics around town.

I really doubt that this will be the case long-term. Probably in most of our life times it will still happen. But at some point the public road infrastructure will likely be shifted to better accommodate AVs (and electric vehicles, but that's another show) which could make operating a manual vehicle on public roads a challenge (like they take away the road signs* and there's an electrified ""rail"" down each lane). And even if there is still the option, I'd imagine it would require some extensive training and licensing. I really think that in this future we'll see an increase in the number of private motoring tracks. Places where you can take your *classic* MV and drive it yourself.

*It's an idea I've seen. I'm not vouching for its efficacy or anything like that. The premise being that AVs have no use for road signs. They have GPS and highly accurate maps.

He identifies gaps in business practice and sees how much they can be improved by running that process up to the limits of physics.

As such, none of his ideas have been outright *impossible*, they're just really really hard.  Throwing away rocket boosters every launch is very inefficient despite being how every other business does it.  Landing a rocket booster under its own power without a parachute is not *literally* impossible and doing so cuts the per-use costs of rocket launches by something like 90%.  So that's where he focused his efforts.

Another example is with roofs. He's moving into roofing with the solar shingles and claims that they will cost less than a conventional roof even without factoring the cost of electricity generated (a point that he added after the original release).

A lot of the benefit of a Tesla roof is simply that there has been no national corporate effort to overhaul the roofing industry.  There are huge inefficiencies that can be addressed: better packaging to prevent damage in transit, better surveying equipment to estimate required number of shingles, better distribution networks leveraging the already nationwide Tesla stores, faster installation using standardized mounting system, better scheduling allowing a single crew to service multiple customers in one pass, better marketing getting America to suddenly get giddy about...roofs.

No. Most of the time a plane has a catastrophic failure the people die. The plane is taken out of commission. My argument is that a catastrophic failure will not only kill the people, but it may destroy the hyperloop itself (the tunnel), but unlike regular rail this will cost a lot to replace.

>  At an uncomfortable but otherwise safe deceleration rate of 2g, you could go from top speed to stopped in under 2 miles.

So while this acceleration seems reasonable there is yet no explanation for how it will stop that quickly. High speed trains (which I mentioned below) use magnetic braking and still take 2km to stop.

The issue is that it's really hard to actually stop something that you've designed to have minimal friction with.

Which leads us to:

> Could you not have sections that open and close for the train like railroad switches?

Probably not. If a 1atm pressure wave is travelling through the tunnel at the speed of sound it's like an explosion. Reinforced concrete is destroyed in these overpressures. We could have blast doors everywhere, but they're not particularly fast at opening, which is already a problem as the segments also need to be massive in case the doors don't open. High speed trains going only 190mph take 2km to stop in an emergency. Given that stopping distance increases at a squared rate, we're estimating a 32km stopping distance! And that's ignoring that the hyperloop is going to have a lot less friction. So the segments are still really long.

> Also, with the distances proposed (a half-hour trip), there's hardly a need for multiple trains in the same tube.

I remember them saying there would be multiple trains at once, but yes I agree you could run just a single train at a time.  It'd be a lot less impressive, but failure would only be single train (though may kill the project for good if it destroyed the tube).

-------------

Note that we already have maglev trains that have never really taken off. Truthfully the main thing that will stop this, even if everything works as expected, is just trying to get the land for it. This thing needs to be pretty straight. It's already hard enough trying to get the land for a regular railway (see HS2 in the UK).

But I'll reply:

and

The ping pong ball being light is about showing the speed the air moves. Of course that part isn't to scale.

The pingpong ball taking up most of the tube was to help show the speed the air rushing in reaches. It wasn't meant to show anything else.

> the breach happened right beside the pingpong ball. Lets see how it would go if it was say, 100m long tube, and the pingpong ball was 99m from the breach.

You're just letting the air speed up. Sure it will accelerate less, but it's still going to be hit by a massive wall of high speed air, traveling multiple times the speed of sound (as shown previously)

> scale matters.

You'd change the pressure of the air, but the speed at which is fills the container would be roughly the same. Though I believe some while back I stated that any air getting into the container would destroy the white paper hyperloop due to it hitting the turbine and causing mass destruction. Again pointing out that the mythbuster example wasn't meant to be a small scale demonstration of the hyperloop, but a small scale demonstration on pressure.

> Frankly, to think that of all the engineers working on the hyperloop, not one has considered, and calculated what would happen in the case of a breach of the tube, is kind of ridiculous,

What engineers? Who do you think is working on this?

We have two companies. One of them is crowd funded and paying its ""engineers"" in stock options and not money (holy shit that's not even legal in many countries). There are very few actual people dedicated to this, and [it may be vapourware](https://www.inverse.com/article/26525-is-hyperloop-transportation-technologies-vaporware)

And the other one, which seemed more legit, is [strapped for cash](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2016/10/25/hyperloop-one-seeks-new-cash-amid-high-costs/#7ea383877854), has gone through controversies involving mismanagement of funds, and really has only shown them building a big metal tube and some high speed tests that are regularly done elsewhere.

The engineers on this come in and get paid to do a particular piece of work, and they're going to do that. Just like any other job, many of them won't care that much about it, just that they get paid.

And why do they think students will help? Getting students to come up with ideas is normally good for the students more than the company. Sometimes it brings in new ideas, but most of the time it doesn't at all. It's rarely something you'd see in a complex project such as this.

-------

Now **eventually** it might happen. But lets not forget that maglev was shown off in 1971, but the first proper scaled system didn't show up for another 33 years, and it still hasn't taken off as a technology.

If they do it, then it won't be in the US. It will almost certainly be in Asia somewhere.

All in all, I just don't see this happening any time soon.

But what most people don't realize is it then takes more power to turn the grid back on. There's going to be a massive power spike as every single electrical device turns on, wakes up, goes through a systems check and then waits for it's hibernation timer. A lot of equipment takes more power to warm up then to simply hibernate or stay on but not in use. Imagine every AC, fridge, TV, car charger powering on and staying on full blast. 

All the equipment for transmission and transforming power takes energy too.

We're talking about a huge energy spike.

Normal a large state will import power from neighbors over high transmission lines especially during a situation like this.

For example California imports 1/4 of their power regularly. This isn't really an problem as long as the transmission system is up to it and most Western countries have invested heavily in upgraded grids for this purpose.

What happened in Oz is that after the SA grid failed it was unable to come up with the spike of power needed to restart and the surrounding power companies in other states were privatized and saw an opportunity to get something from SA. Next the far right party in government that's been trying to hand money out for free to their coal mining friends saw a chance to blame solar and wind while talking up the coal power they refused to sell SA in order to have a talking point in the news about how great coal was. 

SA is doubling down on giving a middle finger to these asshats that would rather exploit them then sell them power like we do here in the states to California all the time.

It may not have the capability of the plant that was shut down but it will provide an ability to keep solar and wind power available for a power spike.

There are other ways to save variable solar and wind power such as pumping water up a hill so it can run a turbine. Tidal power can be more regular too. Batteries are an option. Smarter grids that are adaptable are the future however the cost to change over to these types of solutions are significant.

But a study done in Australia a few years ago showed it was cheaper to build new renewables be then to build a new coal power plant. This makes building new green power a priority, but it is a smart idea to also maintain another option such as gas power plants for situations that are going to demand a huge load.

The SA grid was kicked out of phase from the national grid and the Vic interconnector automatically disconnected SA as a failsafe.

Later on on summer there was a rolling blackout because peak demands exceeded the national networks supply, and SA was the state hit with the bulk of the shedding. Why we experienced the load shedding is at the center of political debate. The undersupply was forecast by AEMO with ample time for operators to fire up gas plants to meet the expected demand. However the operators ended up in a position of being able to force scarcity and that undersupply caused the spot price to surge. It simply wasn't in their shareholders best interest to fire up the extra generation capacity. 

Both of those events were heavily politicised and blamed on the 'unstableness' of South Australia's green energy supply. We didn't need the Port Augusta coal plant to satisfy demands, the high spot prices should have been incentive enough to add the capacity to meet peak demand. 

We are quite happy to give the middle finger to the AEMO and the federal government. The vast majority of us here want to give a big hug to Elon Musk and Mike Cannon-Brooks for thrusting our state into international spotlight and forcing our hand in taking the green path for our future.",tech,t2_q22x,6lx44n,djxt3o4,/r/tech/comments/6lx44n/elon_musk_says_tesla_is_building_the_largest/djxt3o4/,/r/tech/comments/6lx44n/elon_musk_says_tesla_is_building_the_largest/

Oh yeah they will be absolutely starting immediately. Actually given that they have build similar smaller systems already, their production line is probably running constantly and just stashing any extra ones in warehouse in expectation of more contracts. small or big, if it is standard modules it doesn't matter. just matters to many racks get to shipped and where.

As said it is probably standard battery sets and even standard racks & enclosures, so they will just pump them out and store them given that the battery storage market is on rise, so they expect to get enough future contracts. When they get any contract, they just go ""okay this is a X battery rack system"", take X amount of ready to go modules and battery cells there off from storage, ship them to site and install. 

Any sane engineer would have designed the system to be modular, so that the control system, wiring & distribution is by design scaling, so that it doesn't matter if it is 1 rack or 1000+ racks of batteries. just more power switching modules and power conduits in grid etc.

I don't think it will go to inside house level. There is too many moving pieces. But since power companies deliver the meters, they could absolutely design and deliver ones that they can remote manage (or if people buy their own have a standard and demand that any equipment of peoples own directly connecting to grid follows said remote management standard). Of course there would probably be critical infrastructure etc. tiering. So hospitals and other critical stuff etc. get to go first and that standard company x office block gets to stay powerless for little longer, because it isn't really **that** important to society overall whether that company X head offices can't do their business for one or two hours more. if it is for the company, they can have their own back up generators and satellite uplinks to keep power on and out manouver the (possible) communications black out.

Like under which conditions the power company may cut the power i.e. usually only for emergency management and mitigation on moments notice etc.

Also the company already can cut your power off for not paying, they just have to send a guy in and do it by manually flipping the switches and doing disconnects. So this would just move it from manual flipping to remote one. Again there of course must be law (given the critical nature of electric power in the current world) that under which conditions the company may cut off the power due to customer not paying .i.e as last resort of not being able to agree on the matter otherwise and with reasonable warning to the customer for the customer to react and settle their debts to the company.

One payment couple days late is not grounds for cutting service. Rather it must be significant continued non-payment and company must send letter or otherwise notify customer that ""Hey you haven't paid us for 2 months, if you don't pay or agree to a payment plan etc. by end of next month we will cut your contract and your power on day X.""

most of this stuff is more legal problems than technical ones. Remote management handles the ""hard problem"" with only pretty much limited technical solutions. i.e. how we technically get out of brown out. Given that as major technical problem with a workable technical solution is available, then human matters of contract must adapt to allow for adapt.

2938,Akoustyk,http://mashable.com/2017/05/01/elon-musk-ted-talk-self-driving-cars-mars-trump/,"I would imagine that they could easily setup a system where police could first of all know whether or not it was in manual mode, and draw telemetry from the computer. Also, if cars are fully automated, you *could* at that point say that no person may be in the driver seat. Thirdly, every automated vehicle could be equipped with anti-drunk driving mechanisms, which would monitor driving, and lockout manual driving until x hours of being off or stationary, if it deems the driving unsafe. This would probably be the most significant feature. The cars will really prevent you from sucking at driving. They will know what they consider safe, and they will know how closely you adhere to that, and how closely you adhere to not only normal human driving, but also your own habits. So, if you start driving ""strangely"", the car could recognize that, and even ask if you require emergency assistance. 



So, it's hard to say what all the laws will be, but I agree that legally, having a sleeping or drunk driver at the wheel, will take some time after fully automate driving exists in practice. I'd say that right around the time it starts being very common, the laws will start to change for that, and cars will really be available with that sort of design in mind, meaning, you could turn your seats around, recline the into beds, cover all the windows, large TV screens, and all that kind of stuff. 

Driverless laws I don't think will take *too* long, because the cost savings for shipping companies would be significant, so they will push for the laws to be passed, so that they can get their driverless fleets out there, and start making a killing. 

Some other companies like bus travel companies, and taxi services will also be interested in its success. Tesla obviously as well, but although I could be wrong, I think the shipping industry will be the most interested. It would save them on drivers, and also on gas, which over long distances, would really add up.

That won't happen, because the laws will be first in manufacturing, probably first that automatic control will become a mandatory feature, then where cars won't be able to be built with manual control, or won't be road legal if they were built after year x. And then enough years after that law is passed, maybe 15-20 years kind of thing, no cars with manual control will be legal on the roads, period. 

This will infuriate the enthusiasts, but they will be reduced to track days and the such. Which will be kind of sad, but you wouldn't want to drive your car yourself anyway at that point, because the cars will be operating at levels no human could cope with. 

But that's all still kind of a while away. I think though, that once the technology exists, it will move quite quickly. This will be a desirable feature for companies and people, and so it will move pretty fast.

 Hell, companies already have devices built that stay in that port, track everything from your speed, GPS coordinates, engine diagnostic, and report it back to their web servers. I'm sure the vehicle companies can build something along those lines that allows officers to do a VIN/license plate lookup from an app and tell when the last time the vehicle was in automated or manual mode - or even have services like OnStar be able to provide that information.

Writing seems unlikely, though. Getting information *to* your brain is extremely poorly-understood. The current cutting edge of Deep-Brain Stimulation is basically the equivalent of trying to shoot down a mayfly with a duck gun. It'll work if you take a couple of shots at it, but it's nowhere near being *precise.* It is literally stabbing electrified needles into someone's brain near where you think a problem may lie, asking the patient if their symptoms have improved, and then repeating until you find a position that works.

Now sure, DBS can be shockingly effective at treating some things like depression or muscle signalling issues, but it cannot express meanings or discrete quantities in a way that your brain can quickly interpret. That will be a highly difficult task to accomplish.

As a stopgap measure, I'll bet we use haptics; it's well-understood that your brain can intuitively link consistent and well-understood haptic feedback with things like compass direction, temperature, etc. Or maybe we'll just go with the ""voice in your head"" approach - experiments with using vibrating pads stuck to peoples' teeth have shown strong potential for acting as ""invisible headphones.""

3057,Akoustyk,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-musk-neuralink-idUSKBN17N0CU?il=0,"No. That's not true. You just need to be able to receive a string of unique data, that you can know means a certain thing. That means you can calibrate anything to any brain activity, as long as you be precise enough in your measurement of brain activity that you can distinguish unique commands. 

You don't need to ""understand"" the brain, you just need to say: ""Ok, think about turning on the lights."" Then you record the brain pattern that comes out, and bind that pattern to the command ""turn on the lights."" And there you go. Eventually we will think our way through things like that. turning the channel, using your computer, everything like that could all be thought control. However, I'm not certain if you will have to bind things, or if they will be able to get it working in a more universal way, like how voice control is. I'm not exactly sure how similar or consistent brainwave patterns are, but my impression at this point, is that they are too diverse to fit into a universal ""language"".

If they are not, and they eventually to catalog a number of sort of universal commands, then it would be more like what you are talking about, but your thoughts are so diverse. Sometimes words, sometimes images, sometimes sounds, sometimes something more abstract, so, to get to that point, I think would be well beyond our lifetimes. 

They might get to the point where they could know what temperature you like your room to be, when you are ordering or making food, when you call a taxi, and I would assume telecommunications, once a thought to speech protocol gets  created, and we can communicated over long distances with thought alone.

That could potentially be possible. The main problem I see with that, is that people might not be able to distinguish these ideas being sent to them, from their own. You could make a ""call"" system, but that sort of system *would* definitely open the door for people to implant thoughts into your mind, for sure. Building a thought sending protocol might be a little dangerous.

[Here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-28500-8_18) is a link to a 2005 book, and specifically the abstract of it and I'll just grab the relevant bits:

> Experience shows that underground structures, especially deep ones, are far less vulnerable to earthquakes than superficial ones. The latter are endangered by earthquakes due to the fact that the motion of the ground can be amplified by the response of the structure to such an extent that the induced strains damage the structure. The earthquake waves can also be amplified within soft superficial strata. In addition, loose water-saturated soil may loose its strength (so-called liquefaction), and this can lead to landslides or failure of foundations and retaining walls. In contrast, deep buried structures, especially flexible ones, are not expected to oscillate independently of the surrounding ground, i.e. amplification of the ground motion can be excluded. This is manifested by the relatively low earthquake damage of tunnels.1 Of course, the portals may be damaged by earthquake-induced landslides. Very revealing on earthquake effects is the report of what happened to the driving of a 7 m diameter tunnel in the underground of Los Angeles during the San Fernando M 6.7 earthquake in 1971:2

> ‚ÄòThe earthquake caused an outage of electrical power that caused the tunnel pumps to stop. Amid the attendant confusion and anxiety, the miners made their way to the locomotive and drove 5 miles out of the tunnel in pitch darkness. This means that the rails were not significantly distorted to cause a derailment. However, Southern Pacific Railroad tracks on the surface were distorted and broken.‚Äô

So, basically, it has to be in bad soil. Elon wants to put these suckers at least 28ft underground. It's kinda neat how once you get below a certain level the tunnel just moves uniformly with the entire plate, which makes sense when you think about it. 

I don't know how well it would work over super long distances, but I'd guess that as long as you didn't try and cross between any plates, you'd be just fine.

While the book in its whole is about technical, philosophical and moral implications of achieving true artificial general intelligence, it also offers a realistic insight into neural interfaces and their possible role in the inevitable intelligence revolution.

Bostrom himself doesn't see much feasibility in hardware-wetware interfaces, mainly due to high costs of individual implementation and maintenance (e.g. surgery and possible medical complications) and encoding difficulties (each neural system would require unique formatting and training) - at least while a large of portion of available sensory bandwidth (visual, auditory) remains unused and at our disposal. He, however, doesn't rule out a possible paradigm shift in this outlook should a major technological breakthrough occur in relevant fields - something Musk's people may now actually be onto.

Musk has a Bachelors in Physics and Economics. He started a PhD and left after two days to become an entrepreneur (not unreasonable in my opinion). So he has a decent grasp of Physics, but he sure as hell isn't going to be as up to date on advance computational studies of the brain (he really wanted to migrate PayPal over to Windows from Unix in 2000, not sure why), or more importantly how in hell we deal with such an invasive procedure safely. Even ""safe"" surgeries we have at a moment are high enough risk that we try to avoid surgery when possible.

What I do appreciate however is that he's using his ""power"" (i.e. his following) in order to push money into advance sciences and is helping push the boundaries of the fields merely by existing and making a few statements every now and then. More funding is always good.

He described his rocket as ""giant"" and ""one size fits all"". These two things are two of the worst (most expensive) ideas for rocketry. Any extra rocket costs you a lot of money.

Honestly, I think any base on Mars is likely to get huge advantage from manual labor. If a human can do the job just slower then it's going to be a lot cheaper to have the human to do the job. Most construction in 1st world countries is capital-intensive because equipment and fuel are pretty cheap now.

A giant spacestation where you queue up all the equipment for the interplanetary craft. Use dozens (or hundreds) of trips to orbit to build and stock the craft directly in space.

Then when it's time to go, you don't have escape velocity to worry about. ",tech,t2_16ho75,737679,dnpiulr,/r/tech/comments/737679/heres_what_elon_musks_proposed_mars_and_moon/dnpiulr/,/r/tech/comments/737679/heres_what_elon_musks_proposed_mars_and_moon/

Everything you take has to reach escape velocity to get to Mars. The energy difference between orbital velocity and Mars transfer orbit velocity is smaller than the difference between sitting on Earth and Mars transfer orbit. But the difference between the two is equal to how much you spent getting the material to Earth orbit.

I can't really make much sense of what Musk said. His indication that he could use the same large rocket to fly people from city to city on Earth for less than the cost of an economy class ticket doesn't make sense to me. Isn't most of the cost of an economy plane flight fuel? And rockets use more fuel than planes. And planes get to descend and stop nearly for free.

I mean at that point it could be one of these scifi, big, giant, cavernous ring ships with 1000x more air than necessary.

And between you and me (don't tell anybody), I'm not a spacecraft structural engineer, and Musk didn't ask my opinion. Therefore, I'm sure that whatever it is will probably be highly mundane, yet accurate. Just like the first ships to go across the oceans, we're in uncharted waters and everybody is gonna learn something.

As far as cheap LEO flights, sounds great intercontinentally in a shuttle style craft... LA to Beijing or Berlin or Brisbane. Other than that, it may be more of a business strategy statement than anything else; a misdirection for... his competitors?

Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now, so I'll be in my bunk with dat ass. Oh, you! ...now KISS!!! I know you should never stick your dick in crazy, but DM;HS.

...this kills the redditor.

OP will surely deliver. In the meantime, I'll show myself out.

With the air/ gas jest directed towards the rear of the bike, it's there where all the noise goes.

>When riding at higher speeds, things are even worse, because you're not only remaining close to the place where all the exhaust gases start to make noise hitting the mass of air, but you're traveling further from that zone as you advance on the road.

It used to be you paid around $10,000/kg to get something into space.  Maybe SpaceX is a little cheaper but it's still a hurdle.  Another aspect is the customer equipment: SpaceX will need line of sight, high frequency antenna and special receiver, like what Sirius and XM did.  Economies of scale would drop the expenses.  edit: 113 kg * 700 birds * $10k/kg =~  $800 mil just for those, leaving $200 mil for the customer equipment.  Math checks out.

Loon is just a drone blimp/plane using wifi.  Same customer equipment (maybe better antenna) and much cheaper to fly and maintain.

Only when it has gone too far I expect people to rise up en masse, just like it has happened in the past centuries. People usually simply don't give a crap about other's problems, only when it affects themselves they will take action. You can also see this in the past: most screw overs ended with *revolutions*, not *evolutions*, which is a clear sign that shit was going down hill for a long, long time until people *finally* decided to do something about it.

Although I'd really love to see that this time we can prevent that, that we will go the right way before we're too deep in it, I'm highly skeptical that this will happen (and indeed pessimistic). We're getting fucked over time and time again, and even if we somehow prevent some fuckery, they will find a way to sneakily get their way (e.g. look at SOPA). The last several years did not give any reason to believe that we will not get tremendously fucked, even though our collective efforts to stop it. 

The only hope I have is that technology will evolve fast enough for us to outrun those that are trying to fuck us over, until (hopefully) they will give up because they realize their attempts are futile. 

**tl;dr** In the past people also got fucked first, and then did something about it. There is no reason to believe it will go different this time, our best hope is that technology will outsmart the fuckers.

Governments/industries have already tried (and succeeded) to implement censorship, they won't stop just because we want them to.

Regarding the Pirate Bay: I already mentioned it in another branch of the thread, but I'm not worried about governments that try to shut down illegal activities, e.g. the Swedish government trying to shut down TPB because it's (apparently) illegal in their country (whether it should be illegal is a whole different discussion which I don't like to go into now). There is a difference however in trying to shut TPB down and *censoring* TPB by means of (e.g.) internet blockades. The former, shutting down illegal activity, is something governments *definitely* must do. The later, censoring, they should not, regardless of how horrible the part of the internet they want to censor is.

I fully stand behind trying to shut down (most) illegal activities, but censoring is something completely different. E.g. if someone is putting child porn on the internet, I want the police to go find him and take down his servers as soon as possible. However, regardless of how horrible child porn is, I don't want his website to be censored. The internet is build around the principle of complete freedom, and I want to keep it that way. Censorship is a very slippery slope, and IMHO there is no legitimate reason for governments to apply it. It doesn't solve any actual problems, but it does open the door to restrict our freedom of information.

3511,Quabouter,http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/11/7192173/satellite-elon-musk-spacex,"""The internet"" hasn't become twisted and sick. *People* that are twisted and sick have found the internet. That something is abused is not (necessarily) a reason to limit it.

I fully agree that we should do everything that's within our power to stop the twisted and sick activities on the internet, but censorship is not the way to go. Freedom of information is a very important thing, applying censorship to the internet will (eventually) limit this freedom.

But even in the most optimistic scenario, suppose that the governments (or whatever instances do the censorship) actually do *only* censor those parts of the internet that are known to be twisted and sick (which they've already proven not being capable of). Then I'd *still* like to argue that censorship is utter bullshit for the simple reason that it doesn't actually work for it's proposed goal. Those sick people will find ways to work around censorship. Internet censorship will in no way *ever* help preventing actual crimes from being committed, the technology we have nowadays simply ensures that people who actually want to work around censorship can do so, unless the internet is severely handicapped to the point where it's no longer actually usable (and even then chances are that you can *still* work around the censorship). 

So if censorship doesn't actually stop people from performing any crimes, why do we even bother with it? The only thing censorship can ever achieve is the limitation of freedom of information for the average people, and this is a bad and dangerous thing.

While pulling everyone from the grid may pose its own challenges to the large industrial side of our country. I just don't believe the numbers. Elon has been great at making expensive things or items that have little to no stock time. Solar cells attached to the home long term are going to be a different story. To me the real long term solution is to build large bulk power solar cells and small demand response generation (gas). It's cheaper to connect one line to your home and support a larger network then having to fix tiles that are consistently failing.

Something is gotta give to actually target that price: what I think will be, is that he will offer a product that is cheaper than the pricier concrete and ceramic shingles, not of the asphalt roofs, but with worse properties.  
Aim it at the segment of the population that uses those, which is already more sensitive to the environmentalist narrative, and would buy them even just as a status symbol/conversation piece, and you might have it sell enough to actually then reach economy of scale effects and be able to sell it to the rest of the population at interesting prices.",tech,t2_o5t6x,5dp4on,da70w3x,/r/tech/comments/5dp4on/teslas_solar_roof_to_cost_less_than_a_regular/da70w3x/,/r/tech/comments/5dp4on/teslas_solar_roof_to_cost_less_than_a_regular/

Now he thinks they could make it inmediately cheaper than a normal roof. What I think has changed is interest has been high enough, and Musk feels strongly enough, that he is probably pushing them to lower profit margins and bank on sheer volume and being able to streamline and make production cheaper.

Also of note, is I think he is very glibly avoiding the fact that with this new roof you would have to buy at least one battery pack.

Lastly, the most important key: Musk is a huge proponent of vertical integration. That's how Tesla is run. They are going to be soon producing their own batteries for the cars they manufacture which they sell from their own personally run dealerships. And they will be producing so many batteries they will also sell them to everybody else.

> A vacuum chamber the size of a basketball can be a finicky beast, let alone miles and miles of evacuated tube subject to stress and vibration.

I don't believe the hyperloop requires a very hard vacuum. A minor leak probably wouldn't compromise service. As the tube will periodically need to be pressurised for various reasons - maintenance included - it should have adequate capacity to depressurise in a reasonable amount of time and this same infrastructure would be able to compensate for minor leaks. I believe you're also overestimating the fragility of the tube, the stresses aren't terribly high and creating a sealed pipe is a very well understood problem (e.g oil pipelines).

> The docking mechanism will also be necessarily complex.

More complex than a train station, yes; however a low-pressure airlock isn't *that* difficult to make reliable, especially as it's not particularly constrained as a engineering problem (in contrast to, for example, weight and size restrictions of an airtight seal on an airplane).

> Any maintenance inside the track will require venting a section of tube and restoring the vacuum - surely a time consuming process.

Yep, it helps that the vehicles pretty much run on air bearings so there shouldn't be any wear on the tube. There are still plenty of ideas for the propulsion mechanism, if it's an active part of propulsion it may require periodic maintenance.

> There are so many points of failure on a hyperloop, and very little room for redundancy.

I don't actually see that many points of failure, pretty much just propulsion and the integrity of the tube and vacuum. Even in the case of a catastrophic loss of vacuum I believe the failure would be quite graceful with drag rapidly slowing the vehicle. A breakdown would be a serious problem but I can see no obvious reason why the vehicles could not be made sufficiently reliable to make this a very rare occurence.",tech,t2_q22x,3womf4,cxzd7nm,/r/tech/comments/3womf4/elon_musks_hyper_loop_dream_is_becoming_close_to/cxzd7nm/,/r/tech/comments/3womf4/elon_musks_hyper_loop_dream_is_becoming_close_to/

>The moon is harsh. The lack of atmosphere and slow rotation means huge temperature differences between ""day"" and ""night"", which complicates a lot of stuff (rover wheels for example).

So is Mars. Temperatures regularly go below -50¬∞C. The atmosphere is 1% that of Earth. It is 98% carbon dioxide. It has no ozone layer. Mars does not have a significant magnetic field. 

A potential first site for a moon colony would be in the polar regions, where day and night effects would be mitigated.

>Mars is more diverse geologically (more various resources) and we know there's plenty of water there (as ice in the soil and polar caps). Not much water on the moon.

Yes, the moon lacks volatiles. One of the biggest advantages to a mars colony is the abundance of elements. It is a better place for in situ resource utilization (ISRU).

Unfortunately, the places with the most water are also the coldest. 

>You need only a little more fuel to go to Mars (compared to the moon). Travel time is longer, but that's mostly passive coasting.

Travel time is significantly longer. 90 days is insanely fast, and that's still 3 months for astronauts to be literally out in the open with regards to cosmic rays and solar radiation. It is misleading to say only a little more fuel when the costs will end up being much higher just because of safety concerns.

Again, the atmosphere is 1% the pressure on Earth, so no, you can't use the atmosphere alone to slow down from top speed to 0. 

>Potentially, it's easier to terraform Mars than the moon.

Terraforming is not going to happen anytime soon. It is just as speculative as interstellar travel.

>If anything happens to Earth, Mars is much less likely to get affected than the moon.

If something happened to Earth such that it affected the moon significantly, it wouldn't really matter anymore, would it? It would be the end of the world.

Round trip communication delays with Mars are on average, 20 minutes. By contrast, round trip delays with the moon are about 3 seconds. In an emergency where seconds count, the Mars colony cannot rely on Earth for practical advice. 

When I see people say, ""we've already been to the moon, why bother going back?"" That's like Columbus saying ""we've already been to the Americas, why bother going back?"" We have almost no experience with an actual colony that stays at some extraterrestrial location for months at a time, using ISRU techniques, transporting raw materials back to Earth, growing food, producing/manufacturing resources, studying the effects of low gravity, etc. And at least the Earth is reasonably close by when you're on the moon.

Countries will inevitably colonize the moon at some point. They will see its advantages. I'm not saying a Mars colony will fail, but it is definitely a lot more risky.

The entire point of the concept is to find a threshold that is *low enough* that you can achieve high speeds cheaply, and *high enough* that it's achievable with common commercial pumps even with leaks all over the place, and to compensate for the air in the tubes with compressors in front of the capsules to relieve the pressure buildup.

These would absorb the small length changes between pylons due to thermal changes, as well as long form subtle height changes. As land slowly settles to a new position over time, the damper neutral position can be adjusted accordingly. A telescoping tube, similar to the boxy ones used to access airplanes at airports would be needed at the end stations to address the cumulative length change of the tube.

Regarding the pressure (section 4.2, page 24):

Importantly, the Hyperloop design can't use fully evacuated tubes without substantial changes, as the channelling of the air pressure building from the front of the pod is not just to relieve the pressure, but also to be used for suspending the pod on an air cushion (page 4)

Wouldn't this air work as a spring and stop the pod before it will send it in return at massive speed, like any other spring? 

Highly unlikely. First the safest would be to build in control systems to slow the pod if  it meets too high resistance. Air brakes are 150+ years old, and basically involve using air pressure to engage the brakes, and then you actively *disconnect* the brakes such that a power outage automatically, mechanically engages them again. In this case you could additionally arrange it so that mounting air pressure automatically trips the air brakes even when there's still power to the override. The same mechanical mechanisms can easily be used to forcibly cut power to the propulsion. 

Secondly, if there's a major air leak in front of the pod, air can also be pushed out the same way. If the pod has sufficient momentum to massively compress that column of air, the moment it compresses the air beyond the normal pressure outside the tube, where the leak comes from, it will effectively start forcing air out of the leak unless someone is actively pumping air in at high pressure.

Additionally, any air in the tube will spread out over the remainder of the distance, reducing the pressure (or keeping it from increasing very rapidly, as well as letting part of it get pumped out by the pumps further along the tunnel.

At the same time the design calls for the ability to pump air through the pod to deal with the building air pressure in front of the pod, which would at the very least allow for reducing the rate o building pressure.

To get the effect you suggest would require pushing air into the tube at high enough pressure to overpower the combined effect of mounting counter-pressure from the advancing pod, the effect of the vacuum pumps along the remainder of the pipe, and the compressor on the pod, as well as any emergency brake mechanism.

>

>__Power to gas__ (often abbreviated P2G) is a technology that converts [electrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity) power to a gas [fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel).  There are currently three methods in use; all use electricity to [split water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_splitting) into [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen) and [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen) by means of [electrolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis).

>In the first method, the resulting hydrogen is injected into the natural gas grid or is used in transport or industry.  The second method is to combine the hydrogen with [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) and convert the two gases to [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane) (see [natural gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas)) using a methanation reaction such as the [Sabatier reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction), or biological methanation resulting in an extra energy conversion loss of 8%.

That hydrogen can then be used in a hydrogen burning internal combustion engine. But unlike burning gasoline which has carbon in it and therefore which creates CO2 emissions when combined with oxygen during combustion, hydrogen just creates water since there is no carbon in it. 

Hydrogen cars wouldn't require people to change their feuling habits and it wouldn't require as drastic of an infrastructure change as charging stations for EVs would. Gasoline engines can be converted to hydrogen so you may not even have to buy a new car. Gas stations would be converted to hydrogen fill stations.

I in any case don't see why you're so skeptical about this: Tesla produces batteries that have been well tested in their cars. They're mostly a known quantity. Both in terms of capacity, charging etc. This same battery technology has been offered in limited quantity to Solar City customers for a couple of years, so the setup for connecting it to the grid has been well tested (and is in any case pretty trivial - it's not the first time people have hooked up batteries). 

The technology is not new, nor unproven.

It's a ""big deal"" mostly because it's moved closer to larger scale production, which fits perfectly in with Tesla's massive investments in improving battery design and manufacturing.

4009,Unbathed,http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/11/8023443/tesla-home-consumer-battery-elon-musk,"> All I'm arguing is that they could.

I misunderstood. You cited the example of policy changes the utilities made in response to their customers installing solar panels. These policy changes are completely rational: the utilities' cost of business has a fixed part (the distribution network, generators, billing, metering, and such) and a variable part (fuel for generators). Prior to solar panels, the utilities were able to cover their costs predictably with a particular mix of distribution and power charges to their customers. User-owned solar panels cause customers to become co-generators; in some cases, the utilities are required by regulators to buy excess power, but to the best of my knowledge, the utilities are not given authority to shut down their customers' solar panels if they are generating more power than is needed. For this reason and others like it, it is in the utilities' financial interest to change their distribution and power rates to reflect the increased burden of distribution from the compulsory buy-back and the decreased value of electricity from the users' additional generation capacity.

User-sited batteries share none of these features. The battery-owners continue to purchase 100% of their power from the utility; the battery-owner produces no electricity; so there is no change to the variable part of the utilities' costs. The user-sited battery requires no additional investment by the utility in the distribution network, generators, billing, or metering; so there is no change to the variable part of the utilities' costs. 

Customers with solar panels, or user-sited natural gas generators, or user-sited windmills, are distinctly different from customers who have none of these things, because they are both customers and suppliers. To be exact, they are customers of the distribution network, but suppliers of power. For this reason, it is possible for a change in how a utility charges for its services to affect customer/suppliers differently from pure customers, because the customer/suppliers are only buying one part of the package.

Customers with batteries are indistinguishable from customers without batteries. Customers with batteries are merely a part of the class of customers who consume power during times of lowest demand. It is impossible for a utility to change its policy in a way disfavorable to battery-owners without doing the exact same harm to non-battery owners. There is no apparent financial or engineering motive for a utility to drive its off-peak customers into peak times, and ample financial and engineering motives for a utility to want to off-load the cost of storage to any willing customers.

The fundamental savings arise from the utility being able to provide adequate service with a lower distribution and generation capacity and a greater hour-by-hour variability, and from the reduced harm of brownouts and blackouts. It is reasonable to predict that these savings will be shared by the utilities, the battery manufacturers, and the customers through the price mechanism of monthly bills from the utilities and revenues from battery sales. It is unlikely to be a break-even from the customers' point, because unless the customer is allowed some share of the savings, the customer is unlikely to act; and both the utility and the battery manufacturer depend on the customer acting in order to get any returns.",tech,t2_dyc5p,2vn4yi,col1qq8,/r/tech/comments/2vn4yi/elon_musk_says_tesla_will_unveil_a_new_kind_of/col1qq8/,/r/tech/comments/2vn4yi/elon_musk_says_tesla_will_unveil_a_new_kind_of/

From other comments in this thread it seems that the battery pack only makes financial sense for some consumers; probably most places don't have the big difference between on-peak and off-peak unit costs to warrant getting a battery just to spread the load. 

On the other hand, this will change the solar market. My parents installed panels without batteries, to reduce their electricity bill by selling power back to the grid. They were going to pay back the investment in 5 years, but the power company changed their policy and now they don't buy from consumers anymore, so installing a solar panel is a guaranteed loss. A battery pack will make it worthwhile again.",tech,t2_dyc5p,2vn4yi,col216v,/r/tech/comments/2vn4yi/elon_musk_says_tesla_will_unveil_a_new_kind_of/col216v/,/r/tech/comments/2vn4yi/elon_musk_says_tesla_will_unveil_a_new_kind_of/

Apparently there's a race within the car industry to get this tech on the road right now. They differ in their opinions of whether it should be completely driverless, or mostly driverless with emergency take over by the human. 

Google is trying to go the completely driveless route because they argue taking over a car on an instant when you haven't been driving to that point would actually help cause accidents, which they have a point. They've logged 20k miles and have had 8 accidents, all caused by the other driver. IIRC they haven't done much highway testing though.

I'd counter argue that the vast majority of situations that would need to give control back to a person could be as effectively handled by just stopping the car. Right in the premise of the argument you stated is the acknowledgment that we can make cars that don't crash so simply stopping the car should always be an option. 

The way this will likely play out is that in those cases where the car is confused, it will simply stop and ask for help. That would involve calling home to notify all the other automated cars that there is an issue at the current location. A human at a central office could then look at the situation and decide the best solution. That would most likely be to wait until whatever unusual situation the car is in to work itself out. If that isn't an option then the next likely solution would be to tell the car to turn around and find another route. For the worst case, an automated/human driven tow truck could be sent to retrieve the wayward car.

My mother in law, father in law, and aunt... in law? Is that the right phrasing? Anyway, I've spoken about this with them and they all say the idea scares them. All of them are also 55 or older, so it might just be a generational or cultural thing. However, the fact still remains that there's a lot of people that are not only distrustful of technology but _scared_ by it. I mean, for a lot of people, the idea of having a computer _in your pocket_ is insane when not long ago they took up entire rooms. Movies, TV, and other media always love to point out computer glitches and errors when someone bites the dust. Hell, news personalities still say things like, ""A vehicle ran off the road..."" as opposed to, ""A driver ran off the road...""

Me? I'm all for it. I for one welcome our autonomous leaders, but I can understand the apprehension some have about such things. If you have trouble using a PC without getting it infected with viruses, I can imagine the idea of your next car being driven by the computer is a _little_ scary.

As /u/vqhm pointed out, better sensors and crowdsourcing will solve many of the issues you bring up. These things don't pop out of thin air in an instant. It takes time for potholes and construction sites to become significant obstacles. Maps will be updated in real time and self driving cars will know where every pothole and its severity in the entire region. 

Self driving cars alreadycan handle people in crosswalks. In fact with their 360 degree sensors and the ability to track hidden object, self driving cars should handle this case better than humans. 

Stopping the car is an excellent response to an unknown situation. What would you expect a human driver to do under similar uncertain circumstances? Once again the self driving car with its lightning quick reflexes should handle these cases much better than humans. You are operating under the false assumption that humans are good drivers when in fact on a whole they are horrible.

We have to be careful with our wording. *He* hasn't produced those things, the engineers have. Musks contributions have been raising funds and developing budgets. Important work, but not technologically interesting. So it's odd to have this engineer god cult worship of him. Reminds me of the Steve Jobs cult.

The landing is technologically very impressive, akin to reversing a car with a trailer down a mountain, but have they managed to reuse any of the rockets yet? From memory they haven't, so until then we can't claim they've brought any costs down.

He's woefully under qualified and sadly this shows sometimes. He only holds a BS in science\economics and then went out to make bank in the internet boom. The hyperloop is an example.

Tesla cars are nice. I congratulate Tesla's engineers and it's founders Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Lets hope the current CEO can keep pace and the whole operation doesn't implode. Still waiting on that charging network he promised. A lot of promises Mr Musk needs to keep.

PayPal was a named product before Musk came along. Good on him for seeing that digital wallets were going to be a thing and to focus on it. He's a real dot com investor.

Over 50% of cars sold in the UK are diesel, and cars tend to be a fair bit smaller here (as our fuel costs so much more); so yeah, that wouldn't surprise me in the slightest. 

Also, until recently manual gearboxes were quite a bit more efficient than automatics and traditionally 80-90% of cars sold in the UK were manual. Autos have caught up massively in the last 10 years though and UK sales figures for automatics seem to reflect it. ...More recently 25% of new car sales have been automatic.

One thing you also have to be mindful of when discussing fuel economy with folks from the UK/US is that we both use different measures for gallons. 30 miles per imperial gallon is about 25 miles per US gallon, which makes the fuel economy of US cars look much worse.

That argument is iffy for me, just because the Nickel plants that they use to account for the environmental cost in this claim existed prior to hybrid use and its hard to say to what extent the Hybrid batteries contribute.

No gas car is economic compared to diesel though. Diesel have superior engines stability and durability as well as economy. Especially with the development of diesel technology there emissions aren't bad anymore either. I have seen diesel cars get upwards of 1 million miles out of them.

But in the American market, moving towards electric and developing that new tech further is a better option than moving towards diesel. In 10 - 15 years we will probably see electric engines get close to 1000 mile range.

4202,lookmeat,http://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/08/is-elon-musk-serious-about-the-tesla-semi/,"OTOH I would ask: how would an engine without a flat torque curve ever be able to start moving a semi? Basically electric motors have their optimal torque, while diesel engines are not at their most torque when they start.

Acceleration isn't as huge of a problem. And breaking doesn't change.

The problem, as you noted, is battery tech. Diesel is still more efficient at storing energy in space at ~10 KwH/L vs [current batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate_battery) that are like ~0.22 KwH/L, at something of a couple order of magnitudes less. This number is predicted to double by 2020 though.

Things are not as bad though because electricity is a far more efficient way to move energy than fuel. That is internal combustion engines do a crappy job at converting the energy in their fuel into movement. Measuring this depends on the engine and a bunch of factors. Especially since the efficiency is not linear on your internal combustion engines. I've seen estimates that electric engines are from 3 to 4 times than their internal combustion part.

Taking the above into account (lets assume 3x difference) we get that if an internal combustion energy has T m/KwH then an electric vehicle should have 3T m/KwH. We use the numbers above and get that the difference means that a diesel engine is only 15x (down from 45x) more mile for each liter of space you need to fill with fuel vs. what you'd get from an electric car. Once battery efficiency doubles you'd get something closer to only 7x.

The advantage is that electricity can be generated in a bunch of manners that is way cheaper than fuel. Because of economies of scale electricity built at diesel plants would be more efficient than having each car generate its own. Electricity is probably cheaper than even diesel (it's just more expensive to create a container/battery for it). Moreover you could do things such as adding solar panels to the container to generate electricity as you go. And since trucks need to do stops every so much distance it might make sense even with having to charge batteries every so much (this is where switching batteries instead of charging them might make sense).

So you're right there's still significant improvement that needs to happen, but it's on an area that is known will improve soon enough. And Tesla will have the advantage over everyone else in electric engines, which means companies will pay for their patents, or enter a deal where Tesla can use the other company's patent for its benefit in exchange for the other side.",tech,t2_3mrb0,4vxw5c,d6324o9,/r/tech/comments/4vxw5c/is_elon_musk_serious_about_the_tesla_semi/d6324o9/,/r/tech/comments/4vxw5c/is_elon_musk_serious_about_the_tesla_semi/

How much does a Model S weigh? How much does a fully loaded 18 wheeler weigh? Getting the 18 wheeler moving requires a _lot_ of power.

edit:

Doing some basic research;

Model S: ~5,000lbs, Semi (loaded): 80,000lbs.

That's ~~40~~16x heavier. I don't know enough about the basic physics, but calculating the rolling resistance for a Model S versus a semi _probably_ would demonstrate the need for much more power to move a semi.

Too lazy to do the maths, but it seems pretty obvious that you're going to need a _lot_ more batteries and charging is going to take longer (for that many batteries) and the batteries are going to give up their power more quickly, and your range is going to be limited.

Superchargers are the ones built by Tesla themselves. You buy access to these charging stations when you buy your car. If you buy the 85kWh car, then access is built into the price of the car. They're quite fast and can charge from 0-80% in an about ~1hr. Tesla is also building battery swapping at some of the locations, where you can swap your batteries in about 3-5 minutes. Right now, it's still in the beta phase and you have to make an appointment to use the service. 

Destination chargers are put in by the establishments that they're located at, e.g. hotels, restaurants, shopping centers etc. They're usually the high powered wall chargers that you can buy off the Tesla website. The establishments pay for the chargers and usually for the electricity because they want to attract your business or the type of people that own Teslas.

4286,Absinthe99,http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tesla-s-elon-musk-unveils-stored-sunlight-in-batteries/,"> more Musk hype[1] . he's pretty good at it too

Yup, he could sell refrigerators to eskimos.

This particular thing, by the way, is ridiculously uneconomical.

The installed cost of one of these is STILL going to end up being probably around $10k.

Here's the thing, my average monthly ENERGY bill (natural gas heat + electric) is only around $100 ($1200 per year), and only about 1/2 of that is electric ($50 mo / $600 yr), and of that half of *that* is the monthly ""facilities/service charge"" ($25 mo / $300 yr)  -- i.e. my actual kWh electric bill is only about $25 mo or $300 yr.

No I realize that I am at the lower end of the spectrum -- I live alone, I practice energy conservation, have efficient appliances, have swapped out most bulbs for either CFL or LED, and so on -- but even still, most homes really don't have that much HIGHER electrical usage... nowhere near enough  to justify the cost of installing one of these systems.

So what does that mean? I think it's obvious -- just like with the vehicles from Tesla, and the solar panel systems from ""Solar City"" -- there's going to be a push to see these systems SUBSIDIZED.

As the Forbes article you linked to notes:

>>To get your real electricity cost, you have to add to that 15 cent battery charge whatever you‚Äôre paying for that electricity in the first place.

Ergo even if you think you're getting ""free"" electricity from solar panels -- well even there the power is NOT being generated for free -- SOMEONE is paying for the cost of that capitalized system (it may not be the end user, the cost may -- again like part of the cost of Tesla cars -- be shifted off onto OTHER consumers)...

But even in that case, these battery systems still have a HIGHER per kWh cost than I currently pay (even during my daytime ""peak"" rate costs).

Again from the linked article:

>>And here‚Äôs where the economics of the Powerwall break down. If you do not have a big enough solar system to get your home entirely off the grid, **then there is simply no point whatsoever in paying 30 cents per kwh to get electricity via the Powerwall.** At night, when you‚Äôre not generating solar power, you could simply get your electricity from the grid. For an average 12.5 cents a kwh.

>>I‚Äôll say it another way: unless your solar-powered home is entirely disconnected from the grid, or your solar system is big enough to provide for all your electricity needs, an expensive battery backup system like Powerwall does not make economic sense.

Yup... and the only time THAT really makes sense is if you're in a remote location (where the grid don't reach), AND where you get sufficient sunlight -- IOW Arizona. (But then there's the drawback of living in an area that is fundamentally a desert -- meaning you probably USE more power just to run the damned AC and make the house ""livable"", something that is not necessary if you live elsewhere; but that elsewhere is probably not so solar-power friendly.)

Also, as far as the ""off-peak"" bit... well, I looked into something similar a few years back -- just ""on a lark"" so to speak, that since I have a ""time of day"" service, and get cheap (1/2 price) electricity during the night, well why not use that to charge some battery system, and then run ""minimal"" stuff off of it during the day?  Especially stuff that you KNEW would run during the day, every day (like my fridge).

Well it turns out that even using cheap ""commodity"" batteries, just trying to do that in a partial fashion -- enough to run my refrigerator -- ended up being a nonsensical thing, the juice from the battery during daytime (including amortizing the cost of -- a very CHEAP UPS battery system -- and BTW with *zero* ""installation/wiring"" costs, we're talking plugging a fridge into a UPS here, no electrician needed) would *still* have been more on a kWh basis than the ""peak"" rate.

Also, taking that same amount of cash -- what I would have spent on the UPS -- and buying a newer, more efficient (and better insulated) refrigerator... well it cut the power consumption by 1/3 from my previous fridge (and potentially even better if I could just learn how to NOT open the fridge multiple times during the day!)

**What to my mind this all leads me to wonder...** is why people are so ""obsessed"" over the cost of their electricity bills?  Realistically the stuff is incredibly cheap, and I am not aware of ANY case with ANY homeowner where their electric bill could really be considered a MAJOR part of their budget: invariably just about every other category of expense is higher, whether it be their monthly food or entertainment budget (especially if they have Cable TV), not to mention things like  rent/mortgage, or even just their local property taxes.

And arguably ALL of those things are a helluva lot easier to control (or at least are a consequence of choices we have made) -- and arguably most of them are of far less actual ""value"" than the monthly electric bill.",tech,t2_6ljkr,34midh,cqwtrcm,/r/tech/comments/34midh/elon_musk_unveils_stored_sunlight_in_batteries/cqwtrcm/,/r/tech/comments/34midh/elon_musk_unveils_stored_sunlight_in_batteries/

The most interesting funded project from a consumer standpoint is lithium-sulfur, from a company called polyplus. http://www.polyplus.com/page/technology#_lithium-sulfur

Four times the capacity, much less cost and more cycle life. No data on the C rate though

Unfortunately they are too timid to fund the controversial LENR projects necessary to create practical and handheld nuclear powered devices. It is being worked on though, by people who aren't put off by ignorant assumptions that cold fusion is impossible. Due to several breakthroughs over the past six months there are now prototype reactors being built by dozens of teams worldwide. [This video explains how it will work.](https://youtu.be/zMs2We34jXo?t=1693) This nonprofit has finally worked out and published a methodology for consistent reliable results after studying patents granted to leaders in the field so progress is now going quick. 

There's a company based out of north carolina called industrial heat that has been running a prototype reactor using this tech for over a year. They're putting out a press release on their findings next month, and are building the assembly line right now. They are the company to watch if you want to keep an eye out for a mobile device version in the future. But that is assuming they can get past regulatory hurdles first. The reactions are so low powered (compared to fission) that the harmful gamma/xray emissions are re-absorbed by the casing of the reactor and thermalised into heat, but under some circumstances like an intentional uncontrolled meltdown it can get beyond the shield, so it may take some convincing for regulators to accept that it is an acceptable risk.

IH also works with other LENR companies like [Brillouin Energy](http://brillouinenergy.com/), which has been verified by SRI (Stanford University). They use the same underlying mechanisms as the E-Cat, but do not have as many patents nor are they as far along in terms of development. The basic idea of this reactor wasn't created by either company though, it goes back decades to professors Piantelli and Focardi. These are simply a particular kind of refinement. 

We have seen several independent experiments that have successfully done replications of the tech used by these companies based on the patents. We have seen this company operate a massive reactor 24/7 creating about a million dollar's worth of energy over the course of a year, all while constantly monitored by a company hired to validate and specifically make sure there's no fraud. The latest replication was done by the MFMP under the live open science approach where all data is available and all experiments are streamed realtime. You cannot create radioactive emissions without a nuclear reaction, and if you prepare a replication in the way the patent described you indeed get gamma. You even get nuclear transmutation if the reaction goes long enough, which is also impossible without a nuclear reaction. Even Einstein hypothesized that LENR was possible.  

These same principles are being used in Japan right now to develop methods to do remediation on the whole toxic Fukushima mess. Leading LENR researchers from Mitsubishi and Toyota are working on it in conjunction with Tohoku university. To imply the stuff at IH does not work is to imply that none of these or the thousands of successful experiments were legit, which is absurd. I know it seems hard to believe to the casual observer but it's true. Right now the biggest problem the field has to overcome is [the reputation trap.](https://aeon.co/essays/why-do-scientists-dismiss-the-possibility-of-cold-fusion) Not experimental data or even replications, which are supposed to be the gold standard of science.

For example, they list three bets that have to go Musk's way for Tesla to have the expected demand:

1. Laws aren't delayed
2. Consumers follow the laws
3. Tesla makes a mass market car

It should be obvious that this 'analysis' is flawed. Those aren't binary options, and even if they were, all three don't have to come up 'heads' for the 'bet' to pay off.

1. What if the laws were delayed, but only a little? Or only in some states. It's not an 'all or nothing' choice.

2. Consumers don't follow these laws, manufacturers do. And there's a market based penalty in place if they don't (buing credits). Automakers have an incentive to hit the targets, they can even sell their cars at a loss to avoid the penalty. And if they do end up needing to buy credits, that just helps Tesla. This is more of a win-win.

3. A mass market $35k Tesla wouldn't need laws or other automakers to be successful. The Model S is already incredibly successful in its class. If Tesla can get close to that level of sales success in the $35k range, it will be selling cars faster than it can make them. And of course, this isn't a binary result either. A $36k or $40k car won't sell quite as well, and if they can have a cheap version at $29k it will sell even more.",tech,t2_bz6hz,26r4qq,chu54gf,/r/tech/comments/26r4qq/the_cold_logic_behind_elon_musks_5_billion/chu54gf/,/r/tech/comments/26r4qq/the_cold_logic_behind_elon_musks_5_billion/

Used to work for an automation company that was bought out by Tesla shortly after I left. I heard from former coworkers not long after that this is common enough that they have an undocumented policy of offering people something along the lines of a ""severance bonus"" to keep their mouth shut about how they were fired and act like it didn't happen. The joke was that if you got another job, you had to make sure your machine/robot bugged out in front of Elon so you'd get torn a new asshole by a celebrity and get paid extra for the experience. 

Around last January I got a Snapchat message from one around 11PM saying ""It finally happened, I just got bitched out by Elon. Somehow didn't get fired.""

Despite all that, not a single controls guy has left since becoming part of Tesla. The hours are long but that is pretty standard for any controls engineer right now, with automation booming and controls engineers in short supply.

0. Every interaction you have with E is a job interview, either for the one you have or the one you want to be promoted to someday.

1. If he asks you a question, be truthful and terse, lying or floundering will get you fired on the spot.

2. Everything you build is your fault, own it and ask for the thing you need right there, otherwise you're not gonna get it ever.

3. You're gonna lose one of these days, keep your resume up to date before any planned interactions, pack light (try not to use your desk drawers or keep anything you'll need to pack at your desk.)

4. The open door policy is a test, if you use it you're violating chain of command, and at the very least will never get promoted again.

5. If Elon stops looking at you he's done talking to you, don't expect a verbal confirmation or a sane stopping point for a discussion, he's already moved on in his head.

6. Don't fanboi, you're working and that's a waste of time while saving the planet.

WIRED wants us to be shocked and horrified, but seriously, didn't we have a President who raped women and was messing around with an intern in the Oval Office?  We had a great military leader who slapped a soldier or two suffering from shellshock in WWII.   Nuclear navy pioneer Admiral Rickover was famous for his quirks and perfectionism, but you have to be when you're messing with nuclear materials.  A scumbag firm like Goldman Sachs that does nothing to benefit humanity has had interns and new employees breakdown and even die of exhaustion at work if I recall right.

&#x200B;

I'm sure it can be upsetting to have the CEO yell at you and fire you emotionally, but let's be hones, getting fired in any fashion is pretty rough and in some ways it's worse when it's the cold serial killer style of many firms now.  Did you see the movie Up in the Air or read the book?  High end global law firm will decide to lay off people--no real cause, just better profits for partners-- the victims get called to HR.  Meanwhile security waits outside and another security member either packs up personal effects or arrangements are made to ship items home.  The employee who has done nothing wrong is escorted to their car and told to leave the property.  Yes, they usually throw a bit of a severance at the employee, but it's brutal and it's standard.  Meanwhile the remaining people pick up the slack and only get to say goodbye if they already had exchanged numbers.

&#x200B;

My only uncle died and I told my boss I'd probably need a couple days to get to the funeral and back. ""Saturday and Sunday, sure.""   In fairness to him he later said he wasn't being completely serious.

&#x200B;

He's a human too.  He's not perfect.  And he's perfectly right about not wanting to smell burning plastic vapors.  Not good for anyone.

So if you grab a window of that type of interaction. YOu have the guy who is a world renowned designer, who talks with Jobs and says something about Design Jobs knows to be off and then gets fired.

Well, I think you're right that people need to learn to stand up for themselves.  Plenty of people have quit Tesla rather than suffer abuse.  You're right that overall we need a strengthening of worker solidarity and decent unions again.  Usually a big publicly traded company has a professional culture and a human resources department to avoid episodes described in the article.  Sometimes people aren't fully up to the demands of a job, often through no fault of their own.  If the mission is important and time sensitive the company can rightly decide to reassign or terminate the employee.  A really strong union may very well have made Tesla's success impossible.  Nothing in the article remotely compares to the sort of stuff I saw and endured in construction.   More so for much of the military.  I haven't  heard a single story of Elon pushing anyone to do something that led to a catastrophic injury or death.  When you go to work for a new company struggling to compete in a tough industry things won't be calm at first.  And a lot of workers actually prefer that sort of environment cause it's so much more interesting and exciting and challenging.   Perhaps for most would be Tesla employees they should view it as a temporary position where they'll learn and have something interesting on the resume, but not a nice place to think of a career.",tech,t2_3yb2p,axvg1p,ehyyo1n,/r/tech/comments/axvg1p/dr_elon_mr_musk_life_inside_teslas_production_hell/ehyyo1n/,/r/tech/comments/axvg1p/dr_elon_mr_musk_life_inside_teslas_production_hell/

When you get the whole story you‚Äôll quickly realize that the so called ‚Äúaspiring engineer‚Äù was actually someone who was sabotaging Tesla‚Äôs factory by ruining the machinery programming and by sending secret info on Tesla to other 3rd parities. Then when he got fired Tesla got a credible threat that he was going to shoot up the place. Hmmm no wonder Elon was in a fit of rage some guy just tried to ruin his company and possibly kill his staff. Crazy huh. Now I don‚Äôt care to look up and find the real story for all the other parts in this article but I hope this makes you realize that‚Äôs this article about Elon musk being a awful person is clearly bias and fake news. Now I don‚Äôt care anymore I‚Äôm not wasting anymore time on this because it‚Äôs pointless.

Mars escape Velocity: 5.03Km/s

Earth escape Velocity: 11.2Km/s

And remember: Because the rocket equation... with an earth rocket you need to accelerate all the fuel that is going to accelerate you, so it's not just double the fuel you need to get off earth as compared to mars but more like tripple to quadrouple (quick paper math here).

On top of this: Mars has everything you need to produce the fuel locally. And as this is the case - what you actually need at mars is the tools to produce fuel, and then storage tanks and fueling lines to feed into the starships you will be using to head back to earth.

So yes: It is an undertaking. But compared to the initial getting to mars part - far, far easier. After all, we will have invented all the technology to do it already. And if we are half way intelligent in the process of doing this will have tested all of it prior to actually committing to this.

1. Building underground is practical and desirable here. First it gives you access to materials that can be piled up and built into make shift walls and such.
2. We can produce windows that in fact do filter out various forms of radiation - so windowless is not a concern here.
3. Going outside means likely going through an air lock (differential in pressure) and wearing a pressurized or at least semi pressurized suit (pressurized to close to 1G), would need to be insulated, and would need to be sealed against the martian dust - all of this is possible. Oh and the suit will be far, far more manageable then what space suits are for a few reasons that I don't feel like getting into.
4. Robot assistance is desirable anyways.

I mean a few things we will have to contend with: Mussel and bone density loss as less effort is needed to get around on mars. So effort will need to be taken to avoid this issue - and there are some solutions available to us, but they are bulky.

> People would go fucking bonkers. 

I doubt it. VR, video content, work out rooms and so on are all viable. And likely case is we are not going to be building 'small' by any stretch of the imagination do to space requirements for eating, sleeping, working, and so on. And reality is, if we have robots to do the bulk of the work: Cost and time to get the work down will be practically meaningless.

The difficult part will be getting people there in fairly cramped quarters with huge lag time between earth and where they are. In a very real way - as soon as the ship leaves earth, those people should likely consider themselves martians, in a ""we must survive and whatever mission control says is largely a suggestion to take under advisement"".

Elon is just too distracted. He's a good guy to start things but not to run them efficiently. He gets bored and starts building flamethrowers. 

Tesla has been losing money for a long time. He doesn't have a plan to turn it around, which is why many investors are getting anxious.

The Model 3 fiasco also underscores the irresponsible approach Elon takes to business. He makes promises he can't possibly keep. Cry wolf too many time and nobody will believe anymore.

I was someone who pre-ordered a Model 3 because I wanted an electric car like a Tesla and loved the tech.  Was sold on a Tesla that was going to be a car for an average American like a Chevy or Toyota. Got everything lined up, pre-ordered one and waited for a reveal.

Then it was released the price of the options the same as their high end luxury Model S and X.  So rather than a 35k car with a few options I needed like dual motors because I live in the mountains and a few other things the price took it out of my price range and destroyed my dream of having a self driving electric car.

The model 3 isn't a middle class every American car like a Chevy or Toyota, it is a cheaper rich person car like a BMW or an Audi.  I love Elon and I get Tesla is a publicly traded company and he would have probably been ousted as ceo had he not maximized his profits, but he and others sold a dream and failed to deliver giving us a bait and switch.

People didn't like me saying that Tesla and most would say we told you so, you was stupid to believe it would be that affordable, or your just too poor to have a Tesla, etc.

I still believe in the fundamentals of Tesla with electric self driving cars, I think it's lost its way not by failing to meet manufacturing goals, but too much compromising of a vision of changing people's lives and chasing stock prices by public investors.

Which is probably why SpaceX will stay private until there is a full colony on Mars to prevent such manipulations by those who want money more than a better world and some money.

 That's definitely the appeal for me, and I wish more hybrids were like this... being able to plug in and be all-electric for a decent average commuter distance and have gas as a backup, instead of still using gas all the time. The plug-in Prius only gets you 11 miles on electric only, and my workplace is 13 miles away, and there's no convenient place to plug in there. 

The Volt could get me through most average days without using gas at all, but without the range limitations of an all-electric car. It's a pretty appealing setup.

AWD would be nice, but I learned to drive on old 1980's Saabs (I owned 5!) with FWD and no traction control, including wintry conditions... I can deal. :)

I have no idea what you are talking about. Neither Tesla or SpaceX have ever been the most valuable private companies. The top 10 in 2017 were:

- Cargil - $109B in revenue

- Koch Industries - $100B in revenue

- Albertsons - $59.7B in revenue

- Deloitte - $36.8B in revenue

- PWC - $35.9B in revenue

- Mars - $35B in revenue

- Publix - $34B in revenue

- Bechtel - $32.9B in revenue

- Ernst & Young - $29.6B in revenue

- C&S - $28.1B in revenue 

Tesla IPO was less than $2B and it never passed $64B in valuation

SpaceX latest valuation was at $21B. 

Don't get me wrong, kudos for him but his companies have never been the most valuable in the world. 

> But I think you're trying to find small dents in an extremely successful and driven person, and call them huge holes.

It's one thing to be able to start something, it's another to sustain it. 

Tesla production numbers are minuscule compared with any major manufacturer. In fact, none of Elon's manufacturing endeavors have yielded much success in large scale production. 

He had some great vision when he decided to bet on online commerce for PayPal. Others had built online payment systems for brick and mortar and competition from CC companies killed them. 

After he sold it and made $165M, he became very smart with his financial investments, including the take over of Tesla from the original founders. 

However, he has not proven to be a CEO that can scale a business to a sustainable point. That's a different talent and life experience he hasn't demonstrated yet.

The original question I answered: is there someone out there that could do a better job with Tesla dismal production numbers? That answer is a resounding yes.

Regarding Bezos, he has actually built several very large scale businesses: 

- Amazon.com is one of the biggest in terms of traffic; 

- His supply chain is one of the largest and most advanced in the world; 

- AWS is the leader in cloud computing; 

- And in his spare time he's also building rockets. Not with the fanfare of SpaceX but methodically and with his own money. Every year he takes a cool $1B from his Amazon money and funds Blue Origin. While Elon had to sell most of his stake to outside investors, Bezos retains the control of his own companies. 

And that's the difference between a biz dev (great to start things) and an operations guy (great to run things and make them big). 

If I had to bet on anyone being able to make a company scale, that would be Bezos, not Elon. ",tech,t2_2dl3k,8laagl,dzg7k52,/r/tech/comments/8laagl/teslas_promised_35000_model_3_is_still_a_long_way/dzg7k52/,/r/tech/comments/8laagl/teslas_promised_35000_model_3_is_still_a_long_way/

I can understand why GM raised the price when they sold Opel. They surely are selling these EVs to build up the brand so they have a head start when later it becomes possible to make a profit selling long-range EVs at these reasonable prices. Then you cash in on your head start and brand investment at that time. But once you sold the brand, you have no need to build it up for later.

>CEO Elon Musk recently tweeted that the $35,000 Model 3 now won't ship until three to six months after Tesla achieves its 5,000 vehicle-per-week production goal.

>The reason for the new delay in the base model is simple: If the company was to ship it now, it would lose money on every vehicle and ""die,"" as Musk put it.

This means their production issues make the unit cost too high. Elon admitted making a mistake trying to fully automate production and the $35K/unit came with the assumption their investments in automation would pay off. 

Their cheapest model is 40% more expensive than he promised to the many gullible people that forked $1K to reserve one. 

>But they will be cash flow positive

This is not a cash flow issue. This is a production efficiency and COGS issue. Tesla does not have an efficient production model and that won't change anytime soon. 

They also use very expensive components that they do not manufacture. They won't get enough volume discount on those until they increase production orders of magnitude. 

In the meantime the competition is catching up fast and already passed them on self driving features. 

With all the pressure and no actual experience on how to solve the issues, the forecast is bleak for them. ",tech,t2_2dl3k,8laagl,dzesp9q,/r/tech/comments/8laagl/teslas_promised_35000_model_3_is_still_a_long_way/dzesp9q/,/r/tech/comments/8laagl/teslas_promised_35000_model_3_is_still_a_long_way/

This statement seems insanely naive. The company is hemorrhaging money, its credit rating puts its bond issues around junk bond status, and the CEO of the company just came out with a $78,000 of the ""affordable middle class sedan for everyone"", while admitting that if he did make and sell a car at $35,000, his company would go bankrupt.

Generally companies that manufacture automobiles use their own money to invest in production facilities, or barrow and pay it off quickly. Tesla had to raise capital -- barrow money, make concessions on its lease pool, issue bonds, etc, and are generally profitable so there's little to no risk. 

Tesla has only been profitable for two quarters in the history of its existence. 

>As far as I know they are making money on the Roadster, the Model X and the Model S

They're not selling a Roadster -- old or new, so that's doubtful. They might be making money on the S and X now, but they're still hemorrhaging cash. 

>Tesla is in a business where demand is everything, and they have more demand than they can handle which is an envious position for any company to be in.

Yes, but if you can't deliver in 2-3 years, what's to say that Demand won't jump on a ""good enough"" or ""close enough"" product. At least 5 new EVs are hitting the market in 2019.

I can't make that claim. I can however say that none of my rocket-y friends are particularly excited about SpaceX's accomplishments so far in that regard. Also stuff some of them have made is currently in orbit, so they're certainly the crowd you'd expect to be hyped.

Take from that what you will. It is an anecdote after all.
