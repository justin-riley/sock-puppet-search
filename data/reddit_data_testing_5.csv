Unless he's only donating to new, good, Republican candidates. We know the current GOP is a surge of science and the environment and he knows how significant that is. 

Edit: Oh wow this is about Kevin McCarthy, the congressman he donated to: 

>McCarthy is (as of 2015) frequently at odds with environmental groups; the League of Conservation Voters has given him a lifetime score of 3%.[68][69] McCarthy does not accept the scientific consensus on climate change.[70][71] He was a major opponent of President Obama's Clean Power Plan to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas from coal-fired power plants.[71][68] He has opposed regulations on methane leaks from fossil-fuel drilling facilities, characterizing them as ""bureaucratic and unnecessary.'""[68] In 2015, McCarthy opposed the U.S.'s involvement in global efforts to combat climate change; as the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference began, McCarthy announced that he would oppose an international agreement on climate change.[72][73] In 2017, McCarthy led House Republican efforts to use the Congressional Review Act to undo a number of environmental regulations enacted during the Obama administration.[74] While McCarthy once supported the federal wind-energy production tax credit, he opposed its extension in 2014.[70]

>In 2011, McCarthy was the primary author of the ""Wilderness and Roadless Area Release Act"" (H.R. 1581), legislation that would strip 60 million acres of public lands of protected status. Under the legislation, protections for roadless and wilderness study areas would be eliminated, and vast swaths of land opened to new industrial development (such as logging, mineral extraction, and fossil fuel extraction). The bill was strongly criticized by conservationist groups and by former Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, who called it ""the most radical, overreaching attempt to dismantle the architecture of our public land laws"" that he had seen in his lifetime.[75]

They don't make renewable power sources, and they don't even make the most efficient cars on the open market. Teslas aren't any more efficient than some of Toyota's hybrids, and Toyota sells about fifteen times as many of those. Why not be hype for Toyota?

And electric cars do very little to help reduce carbon. Not as long as the vast majority of new electricity generation in the US comes from natural gas. Heck, America still burns more coal per year than we did 25 years ago. Since 1993, the amount of electricity generated by coal/oil/natgas has increased by three times as much as all renewable and biofuel sources. Right now, what putting more electric cars on the road does, is keeps old and dirty coal plants from being shut down.

If you really want to help the environment, figure out how to drive less. Or work on increasing the installation rate of renewables at the utility scale. At this point, America's installation rate of renewable power sources is struggling to keep up with the rate of increased demand every year, we aren't reducing our consumption of carbon-based fuels.

Musk has been so vocal on climate change and his entire fortunes rest on Tesla, an electric car company. His message has been changing the world for the better using science, yet he’s funding the very people in congress holding research back?

The GOP in 2017 is more anti-science, anti-climate change research than ever before. This administration has slashed NOAA funding and other research funding, and has openly attacked the solar industry (of which Musk is also a major player). 

So how can he build his legacy around fighting climate change by promoting renewable energy while also donating to keep the climate deniers in office?

It’s like if Steve Jobs were donating to congressman that supported returning to pen and paper (“clean coal” in the energy debate) rather than advancing computers.

You have extremists on the left and the right who ignore cold, hard facts in favor of how they *feel* about a situation. And many who aren't that extreme tend to only use the statistics that support their argument, and refuse to explore any potential explanations that don't support their worldview.

Science is much more in the middle. Or, if possible, just completely removed from either ""side"". If you want a party that only supports facts and truth, you won't find it on the far left or the far right. Both follow the money and power, as far as politics is concerned. And when it comes to personal beliefs? Horseshoe theory is what comes to mind right there. They might differ on the specific details, but each ""side"" has a host of beliefs and movements that are equally ridiculous.

So why do I believe that science is more in the middle? Because when you don't align yourself with a ""team"", you're less likely to see things through that team's filter. You're more likely to analyze situations independently and arrive at conclusions based on those objective observations.

Science is not a matter of morals really, but a matter of having an objective perspective. Any person that stops worrying about which ""side"" they're on will find themselves more capable of seeing things as they really are.

Take climate change, for example. It doesn't matter which team says what. Science doesn't care that the ""right"" tends to think it doesn't exist, and that the ""left"" tends to think it is a problem that we need to correct (rather than adapt to). Science only tells us the truth: That it exists. Any other moral or political issues completely betray the point of Science: to help us understand the fundamental truths of the universe.",politics,t2_qjh3s,8zpxh9,e2kthe4,/r/politics/comments/8zpxh9/elon_musk_has_donated_nearly_7_times_as_much_to/e2kthe4/,/r/politics/comments/8zpxh9/elon_musk_has_donated_nearly_7_times_as_much_to/

IMO:

* Long term, he's banking on the fact that his businesses will still be successful enough that he can donate to Democrats who will support solar power, electric cars, and space exploration more than R's in the future (once they're in power).
* Reveals that his ""concern"" for environmentalism is a facade, or at the very least takes a hard backseat to the success of his companies.

Makes sense why he'd do it. I don't agree with it and wish he wouldn't, but it makes sense.

No yellow:

> There’s one color, though, that some of Tesla’s former safety experts wanted to see more of: yellow – the traditional hue of caution used to mark hazards.

> Concerned about bone-crunching collisions and the lack of clearly marked pedestrian lanes at the Fremont, California, plant, the general assembly line’s then-lead safety professional went to her boss, who she said told her, “Elon does not like the color yellow.”

Forklifts:

> And in addition to yellow, Musk was said to dislike too many signs in the factory and the warning beeps forklifts make when backing up, former team members said.

At its most basic, the difference between republicans and democrats is money. Republicans want to keep what they make individually, and democrats think we should redistribute to increase the standard of living if everyone.

My parents came from nothing and are very conservative. I’m talking four kids in one room that my grandfather built on the house with no insulation for my dad and two rooms for my mom’s siblings with a single mom who was a waitress earning all the money. No concerns about going hungry (at least that my parents actually knew), but were talking a lot of cheap ass food. I remember my grandfather eating ketchup sandwiches even after he didn’t have to just because he was used to it.

I make a lot more money than most people. And it came easy because my parents put me through college and supported me the whole way. I don’t have the same respect of it as they do, and I consider that both a huge life benefit and somewhat of a setback.

I am more frivolous and more generous with my money than my parents, but I don’t fault them one bit for feeling like they should keep what they have earned after working for it like they have. 

My personal opinion is that Elon Musk wants to make the world a better place. If he supports conservatives so he doesn’t have to redistribute his money away, I’m not going to hold that against him.

I’m not saying that there is no such thing as necessary or moral redistribution where we are trending more toward automation and other cost saving measures that cut out human jobs. Of course we as a species should acknowledge the fundamental rights of all humans and agree to some minimum living conditions.

But do you seriously think that we should take the funding from one of the most innovative people on the planet who could use it to benefit everyone and give it to some chick with eight kids and five baby daddies because she gets an extra $100 in food stamps that she can sell for $30 worth of crack?

And ""deprivation"" well I'm not sure what you mean, but realize that American blacks have a higher standard of living than many whites here and around the world, and have more collective wealth than the entire continent of Africa, and every former colony has a higher standard of living than countries that weren't colonized (there goes that theory), and the left still cant find a narrative for why some types of brown people get affirmation action points in Academia and some get a penalty just like those evil oppressive whites do (btw go to a non-white country and ask for special privileges, see what happens).

That's what we can see.  Donations to campaigns and pacs need to be reported to the FEC, and are publicly searchable on the FEC site.  Donations, in any amount, to 501c4 political organizations (which is how the billionaires really buy their politicians), are only reported to the IRS, not the FEC, and are not public information.  Individuals with 9+ figure net worths literally spend hundreds of millions of dollars on politicians this way every election cycle.

And as of a policy change that occurred today, those donations no longer need to be reported to the IRS either.  Dark money just got a lot darker.

You know how people who are old enough to remember life before 9/11 talk about how people who aren't can't really know what it's like to live in a society that isn't paranoid about and obsessed with security?  20 years from now, young people won't know what it's like to live in a society where we even bothered to pretend that politicians weren't owned outright by billionaires.",politics,t2_qjh3s,8zpxh9,e2l3uxn,/r/politics/comments/8zpxh9/elon_musk_has_donated_nearly_7_times_as_much_to/e2l3uxn/,/r/politics/comments/8zpxh9/elon_musk_has_donated_nearly_7_times_as_much_to/

Often what we call merit is code for other unearned life advantages. A vast majority of software developers, for example, are white young men. If you don't look any closer you can easily be convinced that white young men make better software developers than everyone else. And many white young men who are software developers have come to this conclusion.

But it's not true; if you dig in you find that there are actually complex socioeconomic reasons and effects that funnel white young men towards software development careers. And if you control for these factors these supposed inherent racial and gender advantages evaporate. So what appears to be merit is in fact not.

This does not stop these white young men from believing they have more merit than others, and acting and being treated that way.

Those engineers challenges aren't minor details to  handwave away as Elon does.

And given that he insists on cancelling major public works in favor of Hyperloop, I'd say his hyperbolic business case absolutely deserves scrutiny.

Let's be clear here.  He wants governments to cancel rail projects around the world to fund development of an unproven system whose theoretical maximum capacity is a tenth of the rail system he wants to replace.

False. One newspaper posted wrong info and everyone else reprinted it.

Key facts: vern is not a diver even though most papers(this week, last week was the opposite) published an article claiming he was.  He was not part of the rescue op, even though most articles say he was, some even claim he found the boys in the cave, except stanton and some other guy did and it is on video, yet newspapers still printed the false info.  Plus he isn't a diver, so how could he?

Based on media last week, vern did one thing.  He handed a note of diver names to a thai government official.  That is it.  Now you can say that helped, but if you search ""cave rescue diver"" in google, you basically get links linking to all the guys that helped.(use date filter to remove the last two weeks)  That is no proof this vern guy actually helped.  Funny enough, the guy made a copy of the note before he gave it to the government.  So he sold photos to the media. It is a dry list of names with no expalantion or contact info at all.  Even if they googled the names from that list, they still had to research the people and find out contact info on their own, vern doesn't know the people and had no way to contact them. The government never talked with vern, supposedly only the note was passed.  Vern was never working with them.

Because of his paid interviews with the media, we know he was selling information to the press for cash while divers were risking their lives.  He of course wasn't in the cave and was with the groups of people outside of it.  So the info he gave to the press was wrong.

Now, this is where you ask for a source.  Well, find me a source that specifically says what vern did to help without any of the false info in it.  As far as I can tell, he never talked with the press about what he was doing(because he was doing nothing).  The only interview he gave was to smear musk for helping the kids.  You cannot find any other interviews with vern in them.

You can see the image of vern's note in the media from last week.  Vern sold them the image.

Vern took advantage of the fact that no one involved in the actual operation was talking to the media, so he was able to exploit that and sell bad info to the media.

Proven by the fact that his info was all wrong and he never once tried to claim he was doing any job that was part of the rescue op, he just smeared musk in that one interview.

If you think he helped find me a source that explains what he did.  (good luck, most sources claim he is a diver when he is not and some even claim he was the one who found the kids even though that was stanton.

On the left, you have various social issues that *thrive* on misinformation and feelings-based accusations and interpretations of *pieces* of statistics. Relying on *feelings* isn't a right or left thing. Both the ""right"" and the ""left"" have the same issues. It's horseshoe theory at work. While they are *technically* different, in effect they really aren't that much different, because the approaches are the same.

For every ""America belongs to the whites"" you have a ""Whites don't belong in America"". For every ""Immigration will destroy America"" you have a ""Unrestricted immigration has no potential drawbacks"". For every Climate Change denier, you have people who believe in healing through crystals or something equally stupid. Each side has a series of fads, fears, and causes that all end up being based on lies and ridiculous assumptions. For every ""drugs are poison and should be illegal"" you have a ""drugs will open your third eye and bring world peace and should be legal and not regulated in the slightest"". For every ""The poor deserve to struggle"" you have a ""The rich deserve to lose everything"". There's often an opposite, and yet thematically similar stance represented on each side.

Now, in the current political landscape, the ""left"" *does* have more people who are more interested in facts... But there are still plenty of those on the ""right"" who are also more interested in facts... The difference between them lies in how much or how little they care about certain facts.

Have fun telling certain ""left"" leaning movements that their entire movements started based on lies and misinformation. You'll have just as much trouble if you do that to ""right"" leaning movements that are also based on lies and misinformation.

Politicians? They lie regardless of their ""side"". Journalists? They willingly manipulate information to make their side look ""better"" or someone push their agenda. News agencies? I mean, do I even have to point that one out? Leaders of movements? They will tell lies if it makes their numbers grow or their members cheer.

One way you can see this in action is when you watch those videos that have only a few seconds of an incident. No context. No real information. Just a fight or an altercation of some sort. You'll see people making wild assumptions that require that they actively ignore certain details. It happens all the time, and it's people on the ""left"" *and* the ""right"" doing it.

At their core, how the left and right are *supposed* to work have plenty of room for facts and reality. Ideally, they're supposed to just be two different perspectives on how the world should work. But, because of the bullshit two party system, all politicians do is fight about how the other side sucks, and that's all people tend to do as well.

Science, however, doesn't take sides. People on the ""left"" and ""right"" who take pride in being part of whatever ""team"" they're part of, however, do. So neither the left or the right can be considered ""scientific"", because neither of them truly have platforms that focus on scientific truths.

No yellow:

> There’s one color, though, that some of Tesla’s former safety experts wanted to see more of: yellow – the traditional hue of caution used to mark hazards.

> Concerned about bone-crunching collisions and the lack of clearly marked pedestrian lanes at the Fremont, California, plant, the general assembly line’s then-lead safety professional went to her boss, who she said told her, “Elon does not like the color yellow.”

How is selling reasonably priced cars (if Tesla does indeed sometim start selling reasonably priced cars) ""good for environment""?

99% of businesses didn't start out that way. There are exceptions like Ferrari. But not many.

>He's using the premium he could charge to build the tech and scale to be able to mass produce the vehicle.

Tesla is creating a constant loss. In other words, he is burning money from investors to cover losses from operations and to build a hypothetical $35k car that doesn't exist yet.

People do this thing when they analyze things, they take a bunch of numbers for costs to do things now, and then they do a linear extrapolation and claim the result as fact. 

I mean, its not even limited just to cost analysis. When I was growing up there was stuff everywhere in text books, magazines, news articles, about how we were gonna run out of oil by 2020, 2030, 2050 or whatever.

What has actually happened? We're no where close to running out of oil. Why? because the cost got ridiculous and we developed fracking, now the US is experiencing a second oil boom with no end in sight.

Back to the topic of the hyperloop - the article you posted used one example to say that the hyperloop would actually need 10 tubes instead of 1 to carry the same number of passengers as the HSR, and that therefore it will cost 10 times as much.

That's a ridiculous assertion, making 10 tubes at the same time will almost certainly be cheaper per tube than making just one. Not to mention, Elon recognizes the cost of digging long tunnels as one of the major issues with the proposal, and started a company to investigate solving the problem.

**TLDR:** In the history of humans, no technology that eventually found widespread adoption was ever developed without some naysayer claiming there's no way it would ever work because it's too <insert blank>.

Edit: Case in point, the article you posted is from 2013. Here is an article from 2016 about an actual company planning to build an actual hyperloop in dubai:
https://www.recode.net/2016/10/26/13425592/hyperloop-one-elon-musk-cost-leaked-documents

The article is presented negatively of course, but what I see is that despite the widespread belief that the hyperloop is completely impractical, this company is estimating it could build one between san francisco and LA for roughly the same cost as the HSR or a little more. How is a new technology impractical if its already at cost parity to existing technology? Furthermore, they are making an actual hyperloop in dubai.

The $35k car does exist, and he's making 5k/week of them, and just opened up orders to everyone.

The profits from the premium car are being invested along with the investor money in the infrastructure to build the cars.  If he didn't have that profit, he'd be losing even more.

UBI is \*the\* solution to \*humanity's\* problem vis-a-vis capitalism. It's a universal solution to the disconnect between advances in technology and the ongoing reduction in demand for labour. The alternative is what? A return to serfdom as crony-capitalism runs its natural course into hell? UBI takes the best parts of the free market and wealth redistribution and smushes them into something better.

Long term we're going to suffer decades of under-population crisis. This has already happened in Europe.

Immigration is not the problem. It's barely even ""a"" problem against the scale our own economic systems are impacting wealth. America has it doubly hard because you lack even the basic safety nets the developed world has in place.

Of all Musk ventures, there's only one that is truly financially viable.  And it's the one that is not publicly traded.  

And for all the hype on Hyperloop, there's a reason there's only test tracks and no actual investor putting forward funds for a full build.  Take a guess why.  If the tech was viable at a cost lower than HSR, why do you think Warren Buffet or some institutional investor isn't throwing down?

Here's my bet.  We'll never see a fully operational Hyperloop for anything more than a demonstration track of a few km in our lifetimes.  And I'll happily bet a paycheck if anyone wants.  

Most Hyperloop fans don't realize that the costs of Hyperloop have very little to do with the tech.  And a lot to do with construction.  Building an underground Hyperloop is a lot like building a Maglev in a tunnel.  And we have cost data for that:

Listen. It's simple. So much money is tied up in overpriced Tesla stock that, when the company finally collapses, it could trigger a sell-off and global recession. This would adversely effect the funding available for rescuing the children. Since there is no rational reason for Tesla's market capitalization to be over $50 billion, making it 20% more valuable than Ford even though Ford actually knows how to manufacture its own product, the global economy is heavily reliant on Elon Musk frantically pumping Tesla stock via positive PR. If Musk *hadn't* dropped in to an active crisis zone for photo ops and a personal tour, Tesla's run may have come to an end that week, causing an economic crisis and a run on Thai banks, leaving the rescuers without the resources to carry out the rescue.

No way Trump is just APD. He cares deeply and obviously about his image and harbors resentments for real or perceived insults for YEARS. NPD has that screaming insecurity while APD just don't give a fuck--I like the way the comment below phrases it, about  how we mistake illness for confidence. We do. It's tragic.

I'm on shakier and more personal/less clinical ground with this one, but the way Trump lies feels more NPD than APD. High functioning psychopaths are usually really *good* at lying because lying isn't emotionally stressful for them and they can keep their stories straight. By contrast, NPD people cycle through saying whatever for the immediate situation, saying something else later for the next immediate situation, and then just claiming they never said the first thing ever/gaslighting the shit out of everyone to get them to agree. Sound familiar?

But either way there's a lot of overlap between APD and NPD behaviors. That said...I can't see an APD case [sending a reporter pictures of their hands for 25 years](https://people.com/celebrity/donald-trump-sends-vanity-fair-editor-photos-of-his-hands/), the way Trump has to the guy that called him ""short fingered"" in an article. Trump circles his hands in GOLD SHARPIE. That's such a blazingly NPD type move.

I really feel like most psychopaths just wouldn't bother because they wouldn't give a shit--they move through the world so effectively because they're so often unbothered. And if they ARE bothered...they generally do something a lot more direct (maybe social, maybe subtle--doesn't have to be violent) than whine for a quarter of a century.",politics,t2_qjh3s,8zpxh9,e2kyhaa,/r/politics/comments/8zpxh9/elon_musk_has_donated_nearly_7_times_as_much_to/e2kyhaa/,/r/politics/comments/8zpxh9/elon_musk_has_donated_nearly_7_times_as_much_to/

I totally disagree with your friend. A psychopath/sociopath (they're the same thing, psychopath is just more widely used) wouldn't care so deeply about how they're perceived by others, that's part of their weird mystique. We mistake the illness for confidence.

Trump clearly, painfully desires to be seen as a charismatic alpha-male/titan of business. That's been his chief motivator throughout adulthood, getting the regard/status he's never genuinely received in life. He's always been the punchline, and though he can't allow himself to admit that, he's aware of it on some level.

This article talks about the technology another hyperloop company is developing, and has some specifics:
https://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/09/hyperloop-firm-shows-off-the-magnetic-tech-that-will-help-it-move-at-760-mph.html

A key thing to note is that they are proposing using permanent magnets rather than electromagnets as with the maglev.

> HTT's plan is not the first time magnetic technology has been used for transportation. Currently, a method known as ""maglev"" is used by trains such as the Shanghai Maglev. It requires copper coils along the track and a very high power supply, making the infrastructure expensive. HTT's ""Hyperloop Levitation System"" will do away with the need for this older infrastructure. The track is made out of aluminum rather than copper and much of the power for the motor is regenerated when the pods brake.

I would be extremely surprised if an actual hyperloop route wasn't attempted in my life time, let alone the next 20 years. There are already numerous firms with lots of investment money that have built full scale test tracks, and are moving on with plans to build actual routes.

Here is a most likely overly optimistic article:
https://www.constructiondive.com/news/hyperloop-route-construction-to-begin-in-2019/509811/

They throw a lot of dates out in there, 2019 to start construction, 2021 for production tests. It will probably take longer than that for regulatory approval alone, but the dubai to abu dhabi planning seems to be moving right along too, which will probably face less regulatory issues:

http://www.iflscience.com/technology/virgin-announces-hyperloop-one-route-between-abu-dhabi-and-dubai-that-takes-just-12-minutes/

> You tell me what justifies a near order of magnitude variance from that.

I'm not saying that any of this justifies a order of magnitude price increase (just taking your word for it here), but something I think a lot of the critical articles, especially the first one you linked are overlooking is that the speed of a transportation system is not just a novelty. If you can build a train that goes between san francisco and LA in 2 hours and 40 minutes, or one that does it in 35 minutes, the second one runs 4.5 times as often. Of course with loading passengers and so on it may be less than that, but the point is that time is money, a train that moves people more quickly runs more often, and doesn't need to be as large as a slower train to handle the same number of passengers.

Toyota makes what is arguably the world's best hybrid drive system. They also sell a hydrogen car. What they don't sell is a pure battery EV. And their reasoning is basically due to the issues above... EV cars aren't significantly more efficient than hybrids, or even more carbon-friendly than hybrids. Electricity is inefficient to transport and convert. And the whole charge time thing sucks, not to mention the large numbers of people who don't own their own house with a handy plug.

Sure hydrogen has its own issues, and may never become the standard. A lot of the current problems have to do with just how early the state of research is though, relative to electrical systems.

All interviews are paid, he didn't do that musk interview for free.  Your lack of common sense makes you look dumb.

>Why are you failing to source those specific claims?

Because you need to find proof I am wrong.  Which you cannot do.  No one has printed anything about what vern was doing because he did nothing so he had nothing to talk about.  The note is out there for anyone to see, so you failing to look it up just proves me right more.

Just look at how many articles claim vern is a diver, when he isn't.  Some even claim he found the boys in the cave, which is a completely false claim. He isn't even a diver.  Stanton and some other guy found the boys and its on video.

That doesn't prove any of the claims you have made here.

> Just look at how many articles claim vern is a diver, when he isn't. Some even claim he found the boys in the cave, which is a completely false claim. He isn't even a diver. Stanton and some other guy found the boys and its on video.

It doesn't matter how emotional you feel about it and how much you attack my character instead of the argument. People say dumb shit and to judge a person's entire character on two sentences is small minded and childish. Let alone a person you don't even know.

*In 1977, John Robinette, acting mayor of Vulcan, requested foreign aid from the Soviet Union and East Germany to replace the town's bridge after unsuccessful efforts to get the state to replace it. The bridge was the sole route to legally enter and exit the town, and it had collapsed two years previously.

In the days before the 2016 Democratic Primary election in Michigan, both Clinton and Sanders focused so much attention on Flint that it likely was more high-profile in that moment than it was when the story about their water initially broke. 

To Sanders' credit, he has returned to Flint and still calls for for an end to the travesty, but with all the other drama surrounding our politics, these efforts draw little to no attention. Hillary Clinton, now a private citizen, isn't ending her withdrawal from public life to become an activist for Flint. Even if she did, speculations about a her attempting to revive her political career - not Flint - would be the focus of all the attention.

So, simply put, The Democrats who vowed to fix the problem are out of power or out of office. The Republicans, who have power, never talked much about Flint and clearly aren't planning to do anything. And in between worthless speculations about the Mueller investigation, horse-race coverage of the midterm election cycle, and the depraved spectacle of Kavanaugh being confirmed to the Court, the news media finds a lot more time to shit bricks about Trump's latest tweet than to cover the continuing crisis in Flint.

In the seventies there was a wave of folks tracing their ancestry, ordinary people finally being open about where they were from... Previously that was suppressed in many areas.   White Anglo-Saxon Protestants set the tone.  

I can recall saying I am ""French American"".  And my friend saying he was ""German-Irish American"" and that blew my mind because I never even thought about the fact that the my parents came from one country and someone else's parents could come from different countries.   This was part of a class project in elementary school around 1977(?)


  That's very awkward for a young black kid participating in a class project about ancestry.


 And it takes a few years for the collective understanding of the problem.   Slave American ain't gonna cut it.   Everybody else is talking about what country they're from, so what does a black student say?


 The obvious answer is an African American.


There so there was also a wave of interest in African heritage... which was being acknowledged by the designation.  


 
  It was an element in helping the black community to feel fully American while recognizing their unique experience as Americans.

Not a Republican, so I'm not going to defend them. The fact is that they love spending too, if it's on their stuff. I support cutting spending AND taxes hand in hand, allocating the funds going to the feds to constitutionally defined areas of responsibilityand paying down sovereign debt. 

>And they gutted the SALT deduction which allowed for states to charge more in taxes to solve local problems.

SALT dying was a good thing, just like corn and ethanol subsidies dying would be. 

SALT allowed a shifting of the federal tax burden amongst states, putting more of the burden on those states and citizens with lower non-federal taxes. All citizens should pay equally into the federal workings, as all citizens derive equal benefit from it.

Before someone starts with ""muh poor people,"" remember that the federal government is involved with a TON of things that are not delegated by the Constitution.

A July 2015 email by a regional EPA administrator apologized for the warnings by the EPA’s own employee, Del Toral, and called them an ""unvetted draft."" Despite senior EPA officials’ delays in taking Del Toral’s warnings seriously, they were ultimately determined to have been accurate.

I really don't see how people think that the majority of voters in the South, who've had a history of voting for politicians who supported out right racist Jim Crow laws, would suddenly become the 'good guys' simply because they started voting Republican in the 70s.   Isn't it more likely that no matter what party they vote for will become the 'racist' and authoritarian party, because they are going to vote for politicians that share their views on those issues regardless of which party they affiliate with?

When do people vote in their best interests at the expense of immediate gain? Have they ever done that?

Not only are there hundreds of examples in history to prove my point, there have been plenty of psychological studies on people to prove that this would not work.

We have a system in place and it's called the market. The price of labor is what the market can bear. If your labor is very rare and highly desired, it costs a lot.  Effort and hard work are not components of value.  You could spend 5000 hours on the largest pile of boogers, but no one wants a giant pile of boogers, no matter how hard you worked on it or how long you've studied boogerology.

In addition, if your labor can be done by almost anyone, requiring very little training or expertise, then it doesn't matter how hard you work, there are thousands of other people within reach who can do that work. Everyone getting paid more than you can probably do your job, but you can't do their job (otherwise you would be).

For example, if you’re on a fixed income and your thousand dollars is a majority of your monthly intake, half of that is going to go to medicine and the other half is going to go towards essentials like rent or mortgage. If you make a good salary, that thousand dollars a month is either going to be put into savings, or spent on goods which is excellent for the economy but doesn’t increase or decrease quality-of-life As significantly.

Keeping Social Security or Medicare, or other social safety net’s balances that difference, which means the UBI won’t become a vital income for individuals that are at a disadvantage, it becomes a commodities or savings option for more people. 

I would support Yang’s push for $1000/mo As long as the existing social safety net to stay in place.

1652,newtry,https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8xbnmp/elon-musk-republican-super-pac-protect-the-house,"Because in the American political climate, donating to a politician is much more than simply endorsing or empowering them. Don't get me wrong, it does empower them, but unfortunately, our government is sliding further and further into plutocracy. When big oil donates to a senator, it isn't because they ""like"" that candidate in the slightest. Big oil doesn't have any values or convictions beyond their own best interests, which are usually their own profit. If Elon Musk donates to Super PACs, there is a chance he's doing it for the reason ordinary, non wealthy people do so, to support and empower the politician that holds it, but there's a much bigger chance that he is doing it to add weight to his requests, whatever they may be. We all agreed when Musk created for-profit businesses to sell us electric cars and rockets - because we like electric cars and rockets. Now, apparently, Musk is (very likely, in my opinion) using his wealth to manipulate politicians.

If what I've said up until now has any truth to it, then it is *only* in his best interest to donate to right wing candidates, or candidates that disagree with him. If a candidate has a stance against climate change or space exploration, then he *should* be paying them until they change their mind; this is the sad state of American politics today. If Musk bought out a candidate that was already in favor of vaccines, or NASA, or climate change action, or renewable energy, or sticking it to big oil, then his work would already be done, there is no change in policy desired. When an oil company buys out a left-wing candidate, and suddenly that candidate starts supporting things that benefit big oil, it's because they were paid to change their stance. When Elon Musk buys out a right-wing candidate, isn't it possible we're just seeing the other side of the coin? If I'm angry, I'm not angry at Musk for playing the game as it exists. Until I have reason to believe otherwise, I'm going to go against the reddit hivemind and assume that he's playing the exact same game the wealthy and powerful play in this country, and that his agenda is still space exploration and green technology. 

Also, what could Elon Musk possibly gain by donating to Republicans, that it has reddit angry? Is he secretly in favor of the oil or auto industries, which oppose his own agendas? Is he secretly a fascist that wants our country swung further towards heartland demagoguery? Does he want to build a wall between Mars and Mexico? Just read the title of the above article, ""If Elon Musk Cares About Climate Change, Why Is He Donating to a Republican Super PAC?"". Why indeed, reddit? Use your noodle.

TLDR; Musk doesn't need to buy the votes of his political allies.",politics,t2_1jw9f6nn,8z1t6t,e2g2qdl,/r/politics/comments/8z1t6t/if_elon_musk_cares_about_climate_change_why_is_he/e2g2qdl/,/r/politics/comments/8z1t6t/if_elon_musk_cares_about_climate_change_why_is_he/

Now, while he gave money to the Republicans, he also donated to the Democrats. Now why would he do this? Probably, influence with whoever wins the elections and forms the government. Now, why is it that important to Musk to have influence with the government? Well, one of Musks largest companies is SpaceX, and SpaceX is a government contractor (hope this is what its called), so its dependent on contracts from, primarily the US, government. Now this is where ~~the fun begins~~ the gained influence comes in. Through his donations he gained some influence with the government, which can be used to receive more contracts for his company.

And if they've got the deciding vote in something that *doesn't* affect his business, but that he cares about, they **still** take his call.

His political contributions aren't nearly as large as everyone is making them out to be. If you compare his contributions to other very rich individuals it's completely peanuts.

Here is someone else's comment from the post yesterday breaking down his donations since 2003:
https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8yvtcb/elon_musk_big_gop_donor/e2e65m6/

Everyone is acting like he's some huge donor, but keep in mind thats half a million over 15 years. That's hardly anything compared to his wealth.

Here is a list of the top 30 billionaires and their political spending in **just** 2016 (scroll to the bottom of the article):
https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2017/03/richest-billionaires-are-top-political-spenders/

Musk is on that list, but he's at the very bottom of it, giving only 20k in 2016. What's more, all of his donations since 2003 are still less than what many billionaires spent in just 2016.

These threads about his donations are pretty much a load of nonsense. There are many legitimate criticisms for Elon (like his recent stance on journalists, or his ego, or his stance on workers rights), but his political donations aren't really one of them. 

Also, this thread in particular is especially ridiculous, because under no objective measure could you consider Elon Musk bad for or against climate change.

Stop fucking lying.

Musk has been staunchly anti-worker as long as he's been around. He donates because he wants to, no one forces him to do a damn thing. He could've voted to help elect Hillary if he was so concerned about R's being in control, but I'm pretty sure he didn't care about that, did he? Did he put money behind politicians who support campaign finance reform? No, he didn't.

I do think as a society we are experiencing some new problems with the proliferation of information through the internet. There's always been a lot of noise, but the amount of fake news out there is much greater than it used to be.

Most of these problems come back to monopolies right now I think though. Facebook has gotten too big, and companies like Fox and Sinclair have too much control over the news for it to be unbiased.

We didn't have a healthcare cost crisis until after Medicaid/Medicare. 

>Needs like an employer being able to fuck you any way they want without recourse.

I can leave my place of employment any time I want, and they know it. I gained skills to make myself as irreplaceable to the company as possible, giving me leverage over them and increasing my wages.

>Needs like companies holding monopolies on vital services that you rely on daily and have no choice.

So the most heavily regulated companies.

Mutual funds will pay for my kids' education, no debt required. Also, we didn't have a college cost crisis until government dramatically increased demand without increasing supply. Basic economics.

>Needs like your food / water / air are clean and safe for you and future generations.

Government props up the biggest competitor to clean energy, fossil fuels. 

Every business wants to be more profitable, and efficiency = profit. Making more efficient machines means less pollution, therefore reducing pollution is profitable. Nobody wants an inefficient car, do they? The places that get polluted the most are all owned by government.

>Needs like punishing banks for fucking over our economy and pension and not letting them just get bigger.

The finance industry is among the most regulated industries in the entire world. They like it that way. Who is punishing the banks, anyway?

>On all of these issues Republicans are on the other side than the one that benefits the middle class..

You say, ""benefits the middle class"" but I see prices dramatically rising in every industry with heavy government influence. That does not benefit me.

Nor does it benefit my children who will be stuck with massive amounts of debt racked up by our enormously bloated, inefficient government.

>Democrats aren't perfect but at least they make an attempt to tackle some of these.

Yeah, they made their attempts, and now you're telling me all these things are huge problems.

Right, and I'm sure blacks/the poor in fully Democrat-controlled cities have just been held down by Republicans for the past few decades.

>Our research shows that of American adults who followed these three simple rules, only about 2 percent are in poverty and nearly 75 percent have joined the middle class (defined as earning around $55,000 or more per year).

""So I have to put a foul smelling, explosive liquid into it to make it work?  And if there's no place to get this 
'gasoline' I can't go anywhere?  No thanks. I will stick to my horse that eats grass.""

* American consumers *are* selfish. ""The cars are ugly!""  They don't notice all the electrics that look exactly like normal cars. And what a horrible thing to tell your great grandchildren: ""I didn't do anything about climate change.... because they didn't have the right color.""  

* Many communities have shitty leaders.

* The concept of sacrifice is nonexistent in America. Your point about power is an illustration of this.  











 




   From my perspective the desire for more power is a diseased outlook & morally reprehensible.  But...cars &  are reality, people have an unhealthy relationship with them, and....they *are* really cool.  My CMax parked itself, got 80-150 mpg  & I controlled most non driving functions by voice: ""Climate, Set temperature, 72 degrees"". That's pretty cool.  But I can turn a knob for air temperature too, so...do I really need it? * When your information Eco system is overwhelmed by advertisements that tell you you do, that changes how you interact with reality for the negative.  Life becomes about you and your comfort only.  



The solutions will have to accommodate the stupidity of the market and those solutions will be hobbled as a result.

Oh good. So he'll let unions in his work place to pay them a fair wage. Maybe he'll give up on the 20 billion he's worth to actually make the world better. SpaceX isn't helping anyone but himself. ""Cheap"" rockets are only used by billion dollar companies and countries, he's the rich helping the rich to get even richer. The biggest problems in the world are mass hunger and poverty. The government should take his money and give it to those who need it instead if is hoping he'll trickle down the wealth when he's proven to do the opposite.


>I think he's just an engineer with an inflated sense of self worth that gets off on trying to find clever solutions to the world's problems. 

Like having 100milliok dollar rockets instead if 50 million? Wow, thanks to Musk, there's no longer world hunger because he's saved billionaires so much money! 100k electric cars, just we needed to fix global warming. A billion people can't afford good food but I guess 100k rich people get to feel good about a super car they bought. Thanks Musk, you've sure made the world a better place!

It's changing the game and is having a much greater impact than Tesla at it's respect industry. Its rockets are often 2-3x cheaper than the alternatives and the cost is only going down. They're stealing contracts internationally and in just a few years went from nearly pure gov launches to pulling in nearly half of the commercial global launch market. The company is trying to buyback their stock from employees, and have essentially very little subsidies(standard local, state, county, etc for land and operating incentives) compared to their competitors(ULA has a billion/yr ""Be ready"" payment for ""Launch Readiness"" whether they actually launch or not).

SpaceX is poised to be out in front and currently thriving in the launch industry right now. 

You're absolutely right about working hours and treatment however. Long hours and lower end salaries are there from technicians up to the engineers. I'd assume they are there for the mission rather than the pay though. That's why anyone works there. They drank the koolaid and are willing to work that hard because they believe in it.

So he certainly wasn't helping any Republican causes during the 2016 election cycle.  Once the Republicans were in power in 2017, he started donating to them again.  And he tends to donate more to national Republican causes than to individual Republicans (in the lsat several years mostly just Rohrbacher and McCarthy, both L.A. area congressmen), whereas his Democratic donations are almost all to a varied list of individual candidates.  

I'm not a Musk fan-boy - it just legitimately looks to me like he's playing the game most big CEOs play.  Money for access, on both sides.

Toyota can't win the battery war at the moment, because they are too busy trying to push hydrogen. So far as I know they don't really even have a foot in the race. If someone creates a better BEV than Tesla it's much more likely to be a different car manufacturer.

But the problem with the established car companies is they aren't really interested in electric cars, because they aren't fully compatible with their business models which are intertwined with the maintenance of their vehicles.

I worked for Boeing.  Building airplanes is about as complicated as it gets.  I, myself, was a member of SPEEA, which is the engineering union.  Engineers that design airplanes are a fairly creative bunch, I'd say.

>For example, have you wanted to hire a particularly skilled editor for a movie you've produced but the union the editor belongs to won't let you hire them because other editors need some work? 

You mean unions work to ensure their members are employed before the company can hire from the outside for the same position?  *Gasp* the horror!

Seriously, though, this is such a nonsense argument.  In th vast majority of cases, the ""particularly skilled editor"" has no qualifications or skills that aren't available amongst the existing labor pool, and it's a strawman argument that anti-union employers love to make.

Gaming? Internet services? Music? Movies and Television? These are industries that make shittons of money and are driven mainly by relatively small groups of creative people (for the core processes). They're also a big part of the immediate and long-term future, since they're a a lot harder to hand over to machines.

Now Musk has done plenty to hurt his stock price on his own accord, but there does seem to be a coordinated effort to attack the Tesla stock price to help people make money off of shorting it. CNBC in particular seems to really have it out for Tesla where if any news comes out on Tesla that is positive, they spin it in a negative way. I think Musk goes about attacking people in the wrong way, where you should defend yourself but not send out personal attacks, because then you get grouped in with people like Trump.

UAW really burnt their bridges with the Fremont workers (tldr, in the recession, UAW dumped Fremont to save its Detroit base, or so it goes...), so even if the workers unionise, I highly doubt they'd merge with the UAW...but is there any point in making a local union?

Come on Elon, you name your ships after ones from the Culture series, you should know the path to fully automated luxury space communism isn't built through shafting your workers.

edit (clarification); yes it is a bit of a ""pipe dream"" at the moment and there are bigger issues, there's nothing wrong with keeping a long term goal for society in mind. Especially for when you ask yourself questions like ""where would I want society as a whole to be in 50 years"".


double edit: really interesting to see the range of responses to this. If you think unions are terrible, you should seriously look into data regarding how unions significantly increase income/quality of life for workers and how  wages really started to stagnate around the time of most American unions dying off. 

As for Musk himself, it's pretty obvious that he's got a cult of personality going on due to his innovation/sci-fi encouraging style. It's possible to both admire his vision for the future yet simultaneously admonish him for his shortcomings. There's been much talk of horrendous hours at his plants and offices (just cause he is OK with an 80 hour week doesn't mean other people have to be), as well as some really intense talk of problems with racism in the workplace (shocker, a wealthy white south African man has maybe some controversial feelings).

It's implicit that if they choose to renegotiate their contracts that some terms may change, and that Elon may choose not to make stock options part of those terms. 

And as others have pointed out, other auto worker unions don't get stock options, so it is entirely plausible if they unionize they will lose those.

What I would consider a threat to union workers would be what Walmart does, which is to simply fire them. Though if Elon had suggested he was going to take away stock options from anyone who even ATTEMPTS to unionize, then I would also consider that a threat.

But suggesting that say, the company might not be able to keep as many employees on the payroll if they unionize for higher wages or fewer hours worked in the day would simply be informing them of the reality that their decision to form a union may result in.

In other words, I consider a threat something that will happen to you regardless of whether you form a union or not to punish you for attempting to do so, while something that may happen as a RESULT of forming a union is not a threat, but a legitimate warning that a union may not be in your own best interests.",politics,t2_5gsn3,8o3ufg,e019xsz,/r/politics/comments/8o3ufg/threatening_workers_who_want_to_unionize_is/e019xsz/,/r/politics/comments/8o3ufg/threatening_workers_who_want_to_unionize_is/

A union has a necessary adversarial relationship with management. Their job is to get as much as possible for the workers. So all compensation should be negotiated in the cba. Uniond dont like stock options normally because it requires additional payments. They prefer to opt for their employees keeping as much $ as possible. So they usually go for profit sharing as opposed to stock options. This is good because it gives the employees real incentive to do well in an environment when they are very protected. You might think maybe he should just let them keep everything even if they unionize, but that would put them at a big disadvantage as far as a starting point for negotiations. Stocks will also plummet for a while if they unionize as it will scare investors. Its not all black and white, and most startups pay dick until they finally become profitable, they pay in ownership (stock options) so if he has to increase their pay 3 fold why would he continue the other form of payment?

They're permitted to make their position known and of course may keep union staff (not company employees) off of the premises but they cannot interfere or retaliate in any way.

To this end, employers must be very careful on how they word public statements so as to not be construed as interference or retaliation. Employers must not make any threats, engage in any intimidation or coercion, penalise employees, or make promises.

A statement to the effect of ""We believe that we offer our employees competitive compensation, benefits, and individual incentives that may not be a part of a collective bargaining agreement"" is fine. Promising to give employees a raise if they do not unionise is not.

In my view, Elon Musk's statement does not amount to interference. Stock options and benefits are part of an employment contract and would be the subject of collective bargaining.

How does a union negotiate a contract?
After a union is certified, it usually requests that representatives from the union and the
employer meet in order to negotiate a contract covering wages, hours and other terms and
conditions of employment.

Just reading Musk’s tweets, it is 100% clear that he never said that UAW rules force workers to give up options.  His comment about UAW rules is that they force a strict separation between management and labor.  Which is true.  Were a UAW worker get promoted into management, he would be forced to leave the union.  In case you weren’t aware, stock options are offered to workers in the hopes that it fosters a sense of shared goals and shared ownership.  Unionization precludes the very concept of shared ownership, at least insofar as it’s been defined in the Silicon Valley tech industry.

To be perfectly honest?  Unions should be 100% against stock options because it puts the financial welllbeing of workers into the hands of management.  Management can easily dilute employee stock options to the point of them being worthless.  Unions don’t want promises; they want guarantees.  Stock options also discourage workers from taking collective action such as going on strike, which would drop the stock price.  It also pits the interests of older, retired workers against that of younger workers.  There are lots of reasons for UAW to be against the idea of their members getting compensated with stock options.  And if Tesla workers don’t want to gove up theor options, then they probably don’t want to unionoze under UAW, either.",politics,t2_5gsn3,8o3ufg,e01v56b,/r/politics/comments/8o3ufg/threatening_workers_who_want_to_unionize_is/e01v56b/,/r/politics/comments/8o3ufg/threatening_workers_who_want_to_unionize_is/

Musk is pointing out that UAW is trying to convince Tesla workers to give up their profit sharing.  Ellison may still be right in saying that Musk is not allowed to comment about the outcome of a labor negotiation, *period*, whether or not it is actually UAW that is promising to take profit sharing away. But, there is an even broader context here.  Musk is saying that his workers are perfectly free to unionize, and simply pointing out that, to date, his employees have not been convinced by UAW that giving up profit sharing is worth it.  To construe this as a threat is really just disingenuous and it’s going to hurt the perception of unions in America in the end.  UAW should be coming forward earnestly and making a public argument for why they believe that Silicon Valley style stock options are a bad deal for workers.  

To be hinest, it sounds like UAW’s problems are with Tesla workers not being interested, so UAW is lashing out at Musk.  I honestly want to see some actual evidence of union busting behavior like we’ve seen at major automakers or companies like Walmart or Amazon.  If it’s happening, let’s see it.  But so far the only thing UAW has come up with is that Musk is mean for offering stock options to assembly line workers.  That’s NOT union busting.

Is it a dick move kicking the dude who founded the business out of his role? Absolutely. And to be honest I don't see the point in leaving Eberhard out of that meeting since presumably everyone had already seen the writing on the wall, that was definitely a dick move.

But fundamentally you can't blame Musk/the board for making that decision. These guys were pouring millions of dollars into a company that was in very clear danger of going off the rails. It was absolutely the right decision from a business standpoint.

Now, the quotes about Musk being butthurt about not getting media attention, that's certainly a knock against Musk.

They are not there to have more power. If this was 1920 and the factory conditions were unsafe or something then fine, but in the US today I find it hard to imagine unions do anything useful and in fact may be more detrimental to worker benefits than without.  I have a unique first hand experience of working at two mfg facilities for the same company building the same product with one of the plants unionized. The union protects the lazy workers and stifles the  the ones that deserve to advance since promotion is based on seniority, not merit. Everyone gets a minimum cost\-of\-living raise at the union plant, and the non\-union plant raises have consistently been higher. The non\-union workers are more engaged with their work while the union workers efficiency is constantly lower. The union creates a them\-vs\-us mentality between office and floor associates where the non\-union plant is a more cohesive team all around.  Unions pit the workers against the company while siphoning the paychecks of the workers to stay alive. Our union workers are guaranteed the bare minimum and not a penny more while the non\-union plant enjoys perks not offered to our sister plant.  Unions absolutely have a direct impact on the productivity of a company, and that burden will likely be shared by the company and workers alike.  If Tesla work conditions are poor, then let the workers unionize.  With Musk as CEO, I don't blame him one bit for being firmly against a union. At this critical phase in Tesla's development, the inefficiency a union brings could be detrimental.  A power dynamic is not of what creates a good workforce.

And the amount that the workers are willing to be paid is collectively bargained through their representatives.

> it just doesn't make sense to me that the union would give a damn about the company's stock.

How about the workers want to be paid more but Tesla can’t afford it so they offer stock options in addition which benefit the worker in the long term, not the short, and can be seen as a pay increase that makes both parties happy. Why would a union, who wants more benefit for their members, say NO! NEVER! to stock?

> the company balance sheet is the responsibility of the owners, not the worker representatives. Giving the workers stock makes them owners, it's counter-intuitive to having a union.

Is your argument that paying employees more means the company benefits less? To some extents yes(they will have less money), but it also means your workers will stay longer, be more loyal, work harder. In some businesses this is valuable and leads to a more profitable business.

If workers are paid in stock though, the company spends less money on salary, and the workers(who believe in, and work hard at the company) get part of their pay in future profits due to the company being successful. It’s a win/win, unless the company goes out of business.

Not entirely sure I agree with that. I absolutely can see that unionizing can result in lower injury rate and increased ontime rate, but the only way a union can achieve this is by improving working conditions for employees. This is obviously a good thing but a) depends on how much room there is for improvement, and I literally have no idea without googling what the conditions are like for Tesla employees and b) this can only cost money, in terms of hiring more staff to reduce working hours and presumably lower injuries. The idea that these guaranteed increased costs wouldn't be passed onto consumers is laughable. So a union may well improve these things, but it's costs would outweigh the savings.

Yeah, obviously he isn't in there with the socket set tightening up the bolts on the spacecraft, but if he weren't there deciding that it was a worthwhile thing to do, the guys who *are* wouldn't be. The reason things happen is because people put money behind them. Always. No money, no rockets. This attitude that a leader's vision and drive mean nothing is absurd.

Building the business that makes the rockets is just as important as actually building the rockets. One cannot exist without the other.

Considering that the US government is one of the biggest consumers of rocket launches globally, regardless of who is launching the stuff, why is it bad to provide that service for less money?

Munsk was an English speaker.. Not an Afrikaaner. And he attended Afrikaans Majority schools. First Bryanston...

And then Pretoria boys, which is a huge powerful respected Rugby School. Basically the ultimate jocks. The world revolved around rugby.  In a heavy afrikaans city. 

Honestly you know nothing about aphartheid.. Afrikaaners were top of the chain. 

I had a white non-afrikaans uncle, who was beaten off a bus. He was Greek, and simply had a dark tan from his holidays. Professionals not part of the Afrikanner herritage, had to work 3 times as hard for promotion. Do you think its by chance that Mandelas legal team and base support came from Greek and Jewish communities? Do you think its by chance that Nelsons Mandelas lawyer was Greek?

I mean, its cute, how spoilt Americans think every white person in Aphartheid was better off, when Americans themselves are coddled with a higher quality of life than the rest of the world. Not to mention, America, was far from 'black friendly'... Martin Luther king anyone? Klu klux clan? I think its cute how Americans automatically assume that an oppressive government is naturally better for everyone the system favors. Where were the American sanctions during the black struggle?

There were significant afrikaans networks that controlled shit. Just because you were not at the bottom of the chain, did not mean everything was just rosy. The aphartheid system was class driven. Blacks were at bottom. There was a different place for indians, coloureds... 

Although 'whites' were in a class together 'legally speaking', that does not change the fact that there were different types of whites, and the racial mentality seeped through there too with regards to actual cultural thinking.


And the same logic applied in schools, with jocks, and cultural 'supremacy'. The Afrikaaners in these schools were the top Rugby players. You had to fall in line. Munsk did not like that.

3331,Isopbc,https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolineodonovan/congressman-keith-ellison-elon-musk-union-labor-law,"> Why would a union, who wants more benefit for their members, say NO! NEVER! to stock?

Well, in this case this union works for all automakers, that would mean that the CAW employees at Tesla would be making more than their CAW employees at Chevy and would have more stake in their shop than the other CAW guys. It would also mean Tesla would have leverage over the employees because their decisions affect the stock price that would not be present when negotiating with the other manufacturers. I can see how this could be good for Tesla and the employees, but it's of no benefit to the Union as an organization.

As a general argument against it, when you bargain as a union you take away from the overall profit, generally reducing share price. So if you own shares and you work, what do you want while in discussion with the company? Increase in share price (which usually comes at the expense of workers) or the opposite? This is the conflict of interest that I can't resolve in the whole question.

> Is your argument that paying employees more means the company benefits less?

My argument is that paying employees more money and/or benefits means the shareholders benefit less. A company is nothing without its workers in my opinion, and they deserve a fair share of the 'pie'. If that's in stock or vacations or even a weekly lapdance, they deserve it. 

Unfortunately, unions are generally the only way that people get paid more and have reasonable benefits here in Canada, and it seems the same in America. It makes sense though, if an employer has put a dollar value on their workers trying to change that valuation requires a collective, the individual just doesn't have the power.

The way you wrote this makes it seem like Tesla is willing to hurt their own stock price to hurt the workers? I don't know that much about stock stuff though.

I think the reality is that the average worker cares more about getting dollars that they need and can depend on in the short term.

Also owning stock is a conflict of interest because it might have strings tied to it that forces the workers to stay with the company. Thus it hurts the leverage of the union by being less able to say 'time to walk' if negotiations get sour.

It's a slight issue I imagine(not that I run a union or understand the negotiating process well) and maybe they do want $ for everyone in all their positions to keep bargaining flat and outside of interpretation. Your follow up comment made a lot more sense to me.

Nobody ever says ""i'm getting paid way more than i'm actually worth"". People never think they are getting paid what their worth. everyone wants more. Now couple that with the fact that the very workforce who will never think they make enough als have the power to damage the company monatarily until their demands are met and you have a scenario perfect for extortion. I didnt mention living wage on purpose. Nobody thinks their making enough at any pay grade. But if your making 25 dollars an hour, working on an assembly line putting in a single screw as the part comes by, and you think your worth 30, that doesn't mean your worth 30, and you shouldn't have the right to hold a gun to an employers head to pay you whatever you want without them having any recourse. Companies don't avoid unions because they don't want to pay a living wage or because they don't want their workers to be safe. They want their workers to be safe and they want to pay employees what their worth, not what they think their worth. I'm speaking in the context of manufacturing because of the article, but the fact of the matter is its great to be in a union because you end up making more than your worth due to strong arm tactics but from a companies stand point dealing with a union is a nightmare.

But the power of unions is exactly the reason companies avoid them like the plague. its not because the company wants you poor.

That has real world consequences when you could pay someone a ""living wage"" to do that job, shit you could pay a few people a living wage with that money.

Sure but he also has his money divested in other portfolios. The fact he has that much money based on shares is kinda infuriating. Let me explain:

Let's say Tesla started today and Elon was one of five people working on it. His part of the company is roughly ~20% (assuming everyone is on equal roles and work time). Now the company expands and has 100 people working for it. Right now Elon maintains that ~20% of shares into the company even though the absolute value of the company has skyrocketed! Meaning he has stole shares from 95 employees to give to himself. He should realistically only have ~1% of the shares, not ~20%.

That's endemic to the system, and you're confusing organization with literal capital.

That is fact. The infrastructure, the unimaginably vast chains of supply and sourcing and fabrication of materials, all of that is currently part of a massive global web of financial ties.

Or, at least has not accomplished what his funding has. Without him, rocketry and electric cars would not be where they are today. To say he cannot claim to have built rockets is absurd.

The person cutting the checks *is* indispensable. Without resources nothing gets done. I am perfectly happy to say that the Administrator of NASA is ""building rockets"" too.

People can always ask the question ""Why are you prioritizing this instead of that?"", and once you find a flaw, they are a hero no more.

That's why heroes are either found in a single deed, and not taken as complete human beings complete with all context. The fireman who ran into the burning building, the soldier who dove on a grenade, etc. Or they're...what? Fred Rogers? Who, by all accounts was a wonderful man, found himself in pretty much the only situation which is unassailable: Being broadly nice on TV to children. An amazing role model and friend, but is that even heroic? Is it a ""great"" deed?

Those who get into the nitty gritty of solving more substantive problems can't be heroes. If you feed the hungry, you will either not be doing enough, or turning the screws too tight on the people supplying the food, or preferentially feeding *these* hungry, but not *those* hungry. There's always an angle to criticize. You can't make everybody happy.

Musk is clearly chasing a vision. Employees are often the most expensive part of a business, and if he can save money and keep that business as efficient as possible, he can pursue that vision more aggressively. 10% off employee costs might turn into a 5% total decrease in cost for a given produced good, which might mean a lower price to the consumer or a higher value to the investor. Does that *excuse* treating them poorly? Not at all. But if you have a vision for a world without ICE cars, and view that as being of pivotal importance to the long-term of human existence, how do you weigh one versus the other? Would you not try and pull that line back as far as you could so you could meet your vision as fast as possible? 

It's certainly not a heroic position to be in. It's why you don't often see Superman or Captain America responding to trolley problems. Nobody wants to tarnish their heroes with hard decisions. Never mind the reality that all of us are flawed and not only make good decisions about things where someone will be unhappy, but often make bad decisions because we didn't fully think through the situation.",politics,t2_5gsn3,8o3ufg,e01rv21,/r/politics/comments/8o3ufg/threatening_workers_who_want_to_unionize_is/e01rv21/,/r/politics/comments/8o3ufg/threatening_workers_who_want_to_unionize_is/

In fact, you would think NASA's budget getting smaller would result in NASA getting those contractors to develop hardware that would trim down cost in response, but obviously that just didn't happen; the old school of companies that made rockets continued to practice subcontractor-ception and to this day still have no inclination to change.

No, that's one of the companies that the previous poster was making it *sound like* Elon Musk was treating his employees similarly to. Tesla/SpaceX can't just close-up shop, relocate, and re-hire an entire facility's-worth of employees to avoid unionizing labor the way that Walmart can, doesn't rely on child labor, slave labor or any of those other obviously horrendous practices, and it certainly isn't paying its employees so little that they have to rely on government assistance to pay for basic needs.

The phrase ""discovering America"" is biased towards a Euro-centric worldview.  That word choice suggests either:

1) you haven't critically examined the subtext of that phrase;

2) you think the tens of millions of indigenous peoples were primitives waiting to be ""discovered"" by ""actual people"" (read: Europeans); 

3) the vast continents of the western hemisphere were uninhabited and ripe for the picking (which is not supported by facts); 

or 

4) that the immeasurable loss of human achievement and culture in the western hemisphere is justified by the ends enjoyed today by the descendants of European imperialists.

>I'm well aware of American history.

America didn't exist until almost 300 years after Columbus.  How sure are you that you have a factual basis for your assumptions?  I was taught that the western hemisphere was basically uninhabited, and the only people here were primitive savages, so there was little lost in ""conquering"" indigenous peoples and reaping the ""natural"" resources of the vast continents.  Modern science shows us that that is false--that there was immeasurable suffering, loss of technology, loss of philosophical thought--and that those are *scientifically measurable losses,* not conjecture.

>is your counter argument that humans shouldn't have discovered the magnetic compass because it led to Euro colonization of various parts of the globe? Because that's the logical conclusion to your argument.

I wasn't making an argument, just trying to challenge assumptions that seemed apparent in your choice of words.  I dunno about you, but I always want to refine my stances based on the most pertinent, nuanced, information. 
 
Of course I don't think humans shouldn't have discovered how to navigate.  I am progressive: I want humanity to continue to seek knowledge and wield it responsibly.  Not to belabor a point, but Europeans got magnetic compass technology from the Chinese.

If I can ask you indulge me, you might enjoy a thought experiment:

For millennia, Europeans were highly successful with agriculture.  AND, for all that time, were less efficient than Chinese farmers.  Chinese people invented the moldboard plow in 1st Century BC.  Their agriculture was unrivaled, and Asian populations exploded due to this incredibly efficient technology.

Until the 17th century, Europeans were dragging a rectangular piece of metal through soil to till the earth.  They had hundreds of years to come up with this seemingly-simple piece of technology--a v-shaped plow--but all their achievements and innovation missed out on this.  

One has to admire how well European agriculture did, despite this ""obvious"" oversight.

With the adoption of the moldboard plow, European agriculture exploded.  This was the foundation of the Industrial Revolution.  

Without the adoption of this *simple* technology, would the Industrial Revolution occurred?  Capitalism would not exist without it.  What would the world look like?

I offer this as an example of how humanity should be humbled by simple technology like this.  The peoples of the western hemisphere built vast civilizations--we are only recently, with ground-penetrating radar, discovering just how vast--and they did so *without* the invention of the wheel, *without* beasts of burden.  And their cities were so clean--in such a hot, humid climate, equatorial people bathed often, and collected excrement intentionally to be used as tanning agents, fertilizer, etc., all while the people of Paris were throwing their feces and urine in the streets, spreading disease. 

Those people didn't keep close quarters with their domesticated animals, so they hadn't created species-jumping viruses like smallpox, plague, etc.  That wasn't a bug, it was a feature.  

I will venture into the territory of conjecture: 

If Chinese people had been wiped out, and the technology of the moldboard plow had been lost, would the European Agricultural Revolution have happened?  Would the Industrial Revolution have happened?  Where would humanity be today?  Would you be reading the thoughts of an anonymous stranger on a computer?

It is impossible to know.  But I can imagine a world without Chinese technology, and it's very different.  No gunpowder, no moldboard plow, no paper, no printing.  

You can use the same thought experiment about Europeans: if Europe hadn't invented glass, we wouldn't have the microscope or the telescope.  Our understanding of pathology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, etc. would be stunted without glass, which Asia got on fine without, since they had invented porcelain/china.  

I'm just trying to say we have no idea what kind of progress we missed out on after the catastrophic loss of culture after European contact with the western hemisphere.  I'm not saying anyone did anything wrong, initially--just that I wonder what it would have been like if those indigenous cultures had persisted for 500 more years, or if we had concepts like cultural relativism, or knowledge of pathogens and the means to create vaccines.  It's very broad, but we only have a glimpse of what was lost.  

If you are into ""American"" history, please read that book!  It's fascinating and one of my favorites! :)

It's not so much that they're willing to hurt it - just that there's always change in business and that change has consequences. Sometimes for good, sometimes not. 

I think there have been a few occasions of companies trying to reduce their share price for some reason, but generally I don't think management ever want to have to answer to shareholders for reductions in the company's value.  

I certainly didn't mean to suggest Tesla had any desire to do anything against their workers... but stuff like Enron happens from time to time, creative accounting or something else can destroy a company overnight, union or not.

If you're just speaking TARP, then yes.  Some of TARP was in the form of stock purchase from GM, and that is the part that lost money, I think over 10 billion between Chrysler and GM.  The banks had other, very large open lines of credit with the Treasury.  Accounting on that is trickier though, and the total amount extended was well north of 20 trillion.  

This is a huge topic.  The gist of it boils down to the fact that TARP worked, that money was lost, but it was an investment expected to stabilize our manufacturers, their pensions, and future tax revenues.  In that regard, it was a complete success and we'd be much worse off without it.  

In the end, the industry that caused it all is arguably less regulated post-Trump, and oversight  is still not there.  The banks are exactly who threw the wrench into the economy, causing all the losses in the first place.  Many people will point to the CRA and subprime markets and how the government forced banks into those markets, but that's a stretch as the banks that faltered weren't subject to CRA, and certainly did not have to suck up the derivatives like they did.  And they were overleveraged to begin with. 

And this Great Recession cost the nation an estimated $22 trillion.

3489,IncognitoIsBetter,https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolineodonovan/congressman-keith-ellison-elon-musk-union-labor-law,"There where two separate issues going on with the banks during the crisis that where dealt with differently. There was a liquidity issue and a solvency issue. TARP addressed the problem of solvency by injecting capital into the banks, the lender of last resort window at the FED addressed the liquidity issue by giving short tem (no longer than a month) loans to banks that had to put their best assets as collateral.

The last one isn't a bailout, it's a safety mechanism that exists since the Great Depression to reduce the risks of bank panics by allowing banks to get a short term loan to fend off a bank run and prevent contagion. This exists not to protect the bank, but to protect the entire financial system. In 2008 banks faced both a run on deposits as well as a run on credit, so not only they couldn't access short term credit but they where also dealing with the flux of depositors taking out their money, and this wasn't happening to one bank, but to the entire financial system. The FED acted as it's mandated by opening the lender of last resort window.

Why is this different from the auto bailout? The auto bailout was addressing an insolvency issue by, again, injecting capital into the companies. The major difference being that banks make revenue from reinvesting deposited money, car companies make revenue from selling cars. Injecting short term funding into a car company won't necessarily make them solvent, and they're not even part of the FED system to begin with (they're outside of the FEDs scope).

I wouldn't point to CRA necessarily as the culprit. There's a lot of guilt to pass around, this of course includes the banks but also the Government, Congress and the entire body of financial regulation in the US. Since Dodd-Frank I would say the bank problem has been severely mitigated for now, but the government/regulation problem has been made worse. Macroprudential oversight is still a mess in the US and government incentives for financial risks is still largely unaddressed.

NASA doesn't have the ability to build its own rockets but they need to get things into space like satellites and astronauts. Private companies build the rockets, and NASA pays to use them. Its not money for free and not a giveaway, though those companies that can provide that service for less money will get more of the business. SpaceX allows our government to get the things into space that it needs there for less money to the tune of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, and that's better for everyone. Would you rather NASA cut a check for $90M-150M to SpaceX (the cheapest ride they'll get) or $300-500M to ULA to get the same payload up there? For anyone wanting the government to reduce unnecessary spending, the answer should be easy. Sure there are a couple things that only ULA can do for now, but SpaceX is aiming to match everything ULA can offer and more and given their track record, I would be surprised if they failed to get there.

>Why does anyone imagine living on Mars, a planet that sustains no life whatsoever, would be somehow a better bet than living on Earth? Why would the same things we would do to survive on Mars not be doable on Earth?

Read what I wrote again, and then go read about the Permian extinction or the Cretaceous extinction event. If one of those happens, the planet will be uninhabitable by humans. There will be nothing we can do about it. If something like one of those happens while humans are only living on this planet, our species is completely doomed.

That is the point of having an off-world presence at some point in the future. This isn't about some lebensraum thing where we're running out of land; you're responding to an argument that no one is actually making (that all we need it more space).

If you put a value on continued human existence, then having an offworld presence will be a necessity at some unknown point in the future. At that point (which is unknowable), the value of any resources spent on it will be infinite compared to the value of resources we spent on anything else.

All of the showboating in the meantime may or may not get us closer to that, but whether you like it or not people respond to spectacle.  If you want the world to change to one with a better distribution of resources, maybe you need better marketing for it.

Ah yes, because we use napkin math to send something to space. What are you using to determine if the logistics are completely unworkable? Your gut? Are you an astrophysicist? No? Then cite one to support your claim or stop making it.

And how does a trailer park enter into this? Why would someone send a trailer park into space? Do you know anything about how this would work or are you just assuming we'd rocket-boost a bunch of hillbilly shacks up there? If you don't know what we'd send, why are you saying that it is unfeasible? Do you think that the cost of the rocket fuel is the main barrier? It sounds like you do.

Maybe you should stop talking about this when it's clear that you don't actually know anything about it.


>Discussing what to spend resources when there’s a scarcity of resources isn’t something you get to just handwave away. Shooting sports cars into space when others live in squalor is an immoral waste of resources.

We don't have a resource scarcity problem on this planet for anything besides rare earth metals, which are generally niche use. We have supply chain (getting the resources to the right places) problems. And we have energy limits, but the energy limits are not so much a hard barrier as policy/societal problems.

And why do you assume the money they spent shooting that car into space would have been spent on something that relieved other peoples' squalor? It was venture capital or shareholder money that would have been spent on something else in the company. I might as well say that the money I spent on this chair I'm sitting in was an immoral waste of resources because I could have spent it to help boost somebody out of poverty.

One of the primary means for the international community to show its aversion to apartheid was to boycott South Africa in a variety of spheres of multinational life. Economic and military sanctions were among these, but cultural and sporting boycotts also found their way in. South Africa, in this way, was cut off from the rest of the globe.

Does that sound like a British puppet state during that period? I mean comon man. You cant just 'figure' shit. South African brits always wanted to mantain close relations to Britain. The Afrikaans were more like the Americans, in that they wanted complete independance from Europe. They tended to clash a lot on these subjects. In fact the only 'true' south African white colonial independant Nationalists, as you would find them in the USA were the Afrikaaners, not the English.

> At the outset of apartheid, the United States avoided serious criticism of South Africa's racial policies in part because several U.S. states, especially in the Deep South, had similar policies under the Jim Crow laws.

Indeed America had some of its own laws. Although US racial tolerance was much more than met the eye, culturally speaking rather than 'legally' speaking. Racism, is not just about 'law'.

Regarding Japan, their practices of non-importation, protectionism and isolationism, as well as allowing industry to operate untaxed at the least, and through direct subsidization, is pretty well documented.  These practices in Japan go back to the late 1800's, and were only exacerbated after WWII.

No, they don't.  In fact, Honda ended pensions in the US.  Their retirees simply take MediCare.  GM pays a defined benefits pension plan for their workers.  

> For the Japanese employees at HQ, have you considered that the healthcare system in Japan might be paid by higher taxes? Just like there would be if we switched the US system to a single payer.

Kind of my point.  Japanese automakers don't carry employee or retiree insurance plans on their ledger.  Nor do they pay taxes at a rate higher than the US.

> This is evidenced in the facts. The Japanese corporate tax rate is 32%, ~10% higher than the US rate.

That's nominal, not effective.  Large American companies often pay 0% or even negative rates.
  
> Cut it anyway you want, the US government has given GM/Dodge/Ford billions and billions of dollars. State and local government has given them billions and billions more, either directly or having them not pay taxes, which is the same as giving them money.

> The playing field is pretty level and the non-union workers do just as good or better work than the union workers. The original point, however long ago, was that joining a union gave workers some magical ability to make better cars, which is nonsense.

That's almost an unquantifiable discussion to be had.  Certainly, industrialization led to more uniform production, meaning higher quality controls.  Unions merely upped the safety and work environment levels, likely leading to some more improvements in quality.  The point of unions is NOT to increase productivity, but to make a company better for all parties involved.

No, near-slave-wages has done this.  The fact that we can allow children, the elderly, and the severely under-paid to manufacture items imported to the US, to compete with items made by our own relatively well paid workforce, is what has killed ALL American manufacturing.  We allow the free flow of capital across borders, but not the migration of people.  And that's the crux of the issue.  

You've got some very simple mantras about all of these very complex scenarios, and as typical with a Republican, you just want to spout out a load of horseshit to talk to these complexities.  It's the typical no-win situation for people who care about policy and not platitudes.

Rocketry being what it is, launching 1kg to LEO costs about $20000 at the cheapest. 88% of the weight of any rocket going into LEO has to be propellant, and it’s even more dire if you want to make an interplanetary journey, going to mars would require more than twice that.

This means that the fuel bill *alone* for sending a single person sans capsule into LEO is 1.6 million, completely disregarding all the other costs involved.

I absolutely agree. I'm not saying he shouldn't treat his employees well, I'm saying that the forces involved oppose each other and that that's not an *easy* position to be in. Companies can easily fail. Tesla is not a powerhouse of the industry, its existence is precarious. The decision to push employees hard and not pay them arbitrarily more money might be financially necessary for them to have jobs at all.

Also, let's be clear: When we talk about working at Tesla, we're talking about pretty competitive, but not *amazing* salaries and a culture which promotes a poor work:life balance.

It'll take me awhile on the napkin math, but if what you've got here is accurate then yeah, that's pretty prohibitively expensive at the moment.

The thing is, again, that the relative value in return for *any* amount of expense becomes infinity in the case that there is a self-sustaining colony when that eventual inevitable comet strike or runaway carbon release or whatever happens. You're still wrong about the extinction bit, sorry. And your costs assume a flat technological cost curve. Speaking of which.

>There’s no cheating physics.

You're right, that's why we develop technologies that tackle the problem better. That's what people do. [Oh shit, NASA's doing that now!](http://fortune.com/2018/02/15/nasa-nuclear-rockets-mars/)

It sure is weird that NASA's mentioning Mars there if it's a giant waste, yeah? It's almost like we'd benefit from the technology anyway and using the flashy-sounding goalpost is a way to focus human activity in a place that has longterm benefit. Wait, where did the word ""moonshot"" come from again?

Seriously, you sound like a grumpy old fart from the pre-Industrial period kvetching about how we're limited to the power our wood stoves can provide and we're better off just spending the money on bunion salt for the child laborers than investigating other possibilities. There are WAY worse wastes of money in the long-term than exploring advances in what would be required for a more substantial trip to Mars, and thank fuck you're not the one making that decision.

>Consider for a moment that life survived said extinction events on Earth, but not on Mars. That should be point, set match here.

No, it really isn't, you're comparing apples and oranges and then calling them both kumquats. Mars may never have had biological life in the first place and the habitability issues are not due to the same factors that have made Earth previously difficult to inhabit at various points. And ""unimaginably-expensive-and-nearly-impossible-to-survive-in"" that you can plan for is NOT the same thing as something like an unforseen runaway carbon chain reaction that rapidly raises the global temperature to the point that humans cannot survive or grow their food crops in it.

I quite like her actually. Just had to be a bit tough on her, when you compare her with someone who has had 100 times more humanitarian impact than her.

I initially brought her up as an example of what a white afrikaaner is. And how stupid it is to classify all South Africans who lived during aphartheid as racist or not having a tough upbringing. By the class system, as a white Afrikaner, Charleeze was top of the heap. Yet my initial point, was that a tough upbringing is not just based on government... She had an alchoholic father... so the ironic statement: 'it must have been tough to live in apartheid as a white' is stupid for an american to say... When you have the highest gdp in the world. Its frankly just absurd. Sometimes Americans forget how well they have it.

Also I love how upset you get when you realize how wrong you are about musk humanitarian efforts.

Charleze is cool tho.

Simply put, Musk stimulus, is directed and well thought out so it can work. Unlike for example Oprah's school in SA, where there was child molestation taking place. Oprah did not think about how to create systematic change for the better. Musk does it every day.

The accident happened because they got too close to equipment they weren't supposed to be near anyways.  The guy got close to take a picture of it because he thought it looked cool.  The fact that they didn't know regulation around that equipment is because they don't work with that equipment, but osha can fine them over it because they got near it.

Technically training wasn't inadequate.  They aren't going to educate workers on equipment they don't need to know about.  In cases like this the training should basically say anything you don't know about is conisidered unsafe.

He knows the uaw is going to fuck his company up.  An example, tesla is using consulting companies to staff the line because they cannot hire and train fast enough, so they are paying for already trained temporary workers.  If this was a uaw shop, telsa would have to pay union dues for every temp worker who are not getting any union benefits even though they are not displacing any union worker.  They actually cost more and are there to fill in gaps until tesla can hire and train a replacement.

Others center around what musk was talking about, the uaw is going to want the benefits the other uaw employees get, even if they don't benefit tesla workers.

I hope they fine that contractor a ton for sending untrained workers to do work while billing them as trained workers.  Tesla got burned.

Most likely tesla hired that company purely because that company was offering already trained employees ready to go and work with no down time.  If tesla hired directly, it could take months to get a worker up to a high level.  So tesla is using trained contrators(which are more expensive) to get production up and will most likely hire and train their own replacements over time until they no longer have contractors working.

Companies use contractors like this to get skilled labor in periods where they need work done now and cannot wait for their normal hiring and training practices to get workers in.

This really wasn't caused by anything tesla did and claiming its evidence against tesla is silly.  They paid extra to avoid injuries by having skilled people do the work instead of trying to throw a new hire into job they weren't ready for.",politics,t2_5gsn3,8o3ufg,e025iah,/r/politics/comments/8o3ufg/threatening_workers_who_want_to_unionize_is/e025iah/,/r/politics/comments/8o3ufg/threatening_workers_who_want_to_unionize_is/

A job is something someone does; those two components are critical, something+someone. If Bill Gates created anything it was product. The product required people to do something to produce his product, so he has job *vacancies* to fill; he needs people to come and work to produce the products. 

It's worth noting at this point that Bill's ""products"" are little more than ideas. The people who will turn those ideas into reality will be highly skilled in their arts. Bill's products cannot be made by just anyone and at this point, Bill has yet to make his billions so he can't afford to take on unskilled people and train them, he must have people will the skills but it's worth noting that even when companies do have billions, they look to recruit already skilled staff.

At that point, it is questionable that Bill is creating jobs. He needs skilled people and without those skills, there are no jobs - only vacancies. So who is creating the jobs - the people getting the skills to do the jobs or the people swanning about dreaming up big ideas as to what those people can do to make the ideas people some money? If Bill didn't exist would someone else be looking for those skills to make products - that nice Mr Jobs at Apple perhaps? So if the people with the right skills would have a job with Mr Jobs if Bill didn't exist, how can we say that Bill is creating jobs?

So if Bill and Steve aren't creating jobs what are they doing? They certainly have some control over the jobs that people are doing - because someone working for them cannot work for someone else. So at best we can say they control jobs.

He has consistently stated that he does stuff like this out of a hope that those politicians will listen to him later on environmental issues. 

It seems totally reasonable to criticize him for donating to causes he disagrees with (in the same way that there was public pressure to get off of Trump's advisory councils), because it's not obvious that his method has any chance of success. But that's a disagreement over methods, not values. 

His publicly stated values w.r.t. environmentalism are:
> [Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/870369915894546432)

why the fuck are u donating to ppl that don’t believe in climate change and are separating kids from their families then - twitter

> [So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1018268378962640896)

>To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent & politically moderate. Doesn’t mean I’m moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me & I don’t understand why they are not important to everyone.
>[A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1018290544986845184)

There have got to be better topics of debate than whether @elonmusk is committed to climate action. He has dedicated his career to the mission of replacing fossil fuels with clean energy & has strongly backed the Sierra Club's advocacy work. We are proud to have his support. - @SierraClub
>[Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1018321524728610817)

Are you ANY kind of donor to the GOP? - twitter

In short, he's about as environmentally progressive as you would expect from someone who poured his fortune into solar panels, electric cars, and reusable rockets. But not taking a strong anti-GOP stance on all issues, because of some combination of *a)* optimism about being able to influence the administration as a moderate and *b)* self-interest (since SpaceX benefits from a lot of government projects).

3902,lemon900098,https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-unmasked-as-top-donor-to-house-republican-pac,"Call me paranoid, but the super-aggressive rhetoric and hatred in /r/politics has gotten a lot worse since the indictments on friday. The one piece of new information we got was about the republican candidate asking Guciffer for info. All of the other information we already knew. The article from a year ago about the dutch having access to the Russian computers already told us that Russia hacked US systems. Guccifer being russian we knew, Stone talking with guccifer we knew. 

I think most republicans in government at this point don't deserve any kind of support, and quite a lot of them should be kicked from office, or even jailed. But since friday that kind of thinking is now seemingly mild compared to a lot of commentators. The hatred has really been kicked up a notch, and I don't think the response is proportionate to what has happened. 

From 2016:

>[Today's Russia is having the opposite effect, dividing many Republicans and Democrats and illustrating the larger breakdown of a national consensus on major foreign policy questions.](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/12/12/505252184/how-russia-went-from-uniting-to-dividing-u-s-politics)

What I'm trying to say, to any Americans in this thread, is that perhaps the thing that Russia did in 2016 and hasn't stopped doing, they are still doing, and might have even kicked it up a notch since friday. Also from friday:

>[Coats said Friday that intelligence officials have seen ""aggressive attempts to manipulate social media and to spread propaganda focused on hot-button issues that are intended to exacerbate social, political divisions.""](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/14/politics/director-of-national-intelligence-dan-coats-cyberattacks-russia/index.html)",politics,t2_qkaot,8yvtcb,e2edyll,/r/politics/comments/8yvtcb/elon_musk_big_gop_donor/e2edyll/,/r/politics/comments/8yvtcb/elon_musk_big_gop_donor/

Elon's no sinless saint, but neither is he a man of evil. He wants to do good for the world, but also wants to well for himself. He wants to take care of his workers, but he also wants more control over his company, which is probably why he is against unionization, and would rather just take care of them just well enough that they don't demand one too hard.

We don't have to agree with everything he does (I don't, I support unionization), but we can at least see that he does some good for the world... which the GOP hasn't been doing at all, for decades.

The results are: 

(D) $171,750

(R) $334,600 **If** you include his $38,900 donation that is currently processing by the FCC placed 06/05/2018 [linked here.](https://mobile.twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1018172506472112128). If you don’t include it and only include the numbers we can verify on open secrets, then he has only donated $295,700 to Republicans.

Copied from [another user](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8yvtcb/elon_musk_big_gop_donor/e2e3w82/) to clarify further:


Since September 2015 he has donated the following:

 • $10,800 to Dianne Feinstein (D)
 • $7500 to the DNC
 • $15,000 to the SpaceX Super PAC
 • $5,400 to Kevin McCarthy (R)
 • $44,600 to the RNC

https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=musk%2C+elon

Further Edit:
Of the SpaceX Super PAC contributions to candidates ($196,000) approximately 42% went to Democrats, 58% to Republicans.
Additionally they have donated $30,000 to the RNC and $10,000 to the DNC.

https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00411116&cycle=2018

$110,620 to (D) and $193,680 to (R).

Martin recommended replacing himself as CEO months before he was demoted. Martin was kept out of the loop *by the board* during the decision to replace him (he says not a single board member told him what was discussed, that says something to me...) -- after the quest to find a replacement CEO was unfruitful. Martin wasn't replaced by Musk, he was replaced with Michael Marks. The *board* chose to replace Martin -- sure, Musk probably had a lot of sway.

To be frank, with as much as Elon had invested into Tesla at that point, I don't blame him for using his power to  attempt to move the company forward with or without the founders -- if that's what happened. Fact of the matter is, even if that is what happened, it doesn't make Musk a scumbag by default unless you consider protecting your investment being a scumbag

I'm sure there are many worse stories out there that show Musk in a bad light (I wonder moreover why everyone is trying to show him in a bad light all of the sudden? Who cares? What changed?), but this shit here is straight business.

Edit: and also, to make it sound like Musk was some distant businessman that swooped in after success was guaranteed to claim the title of founder isn't founded. The company incorporated in July 2003, Musk was brought on as chairman of the board and to lead Series A funding in February 2004. That's only 7 months.

4271,RepresentativeZombie,https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-unmasked-as-top-donor-to-house-republican-pac,"Republicans, specifically in the last 20 years or so, have been incredibly brazen about solidifying their advantages. Democratic legislatures have gerrymandered within their own states, but there was never anything on the scale of 2010's Project Redmap. They never stole a supreme court seat, or refused to even hold hearings, in the way that Senate Republicans did with Merrick Garland and Neil Gorsuch. McConnell has generally twisted the rules every way he can to provide a Republican advantage, in a way that's mostly unprecedented. The closest the Democrats have come is when Harry Reid ended most filibusters for lower-court judicial nominations, but that was done in reaction to McConnell's partisan stonewalling. Likewise, McConnell has continued to expand the elimination of the filibuster.

Republicans have lost the popular vote in 6 out of the last 7 presidential elections, and yet won three presidential terms. Soon, a majority of the sitting Supreme Court Justices will likely have been seated by presidents who lost the popular vote. The supreme court, which was already right-wing on most issues, will veer further to the right. With Kennedy and Scalia, the court made a number of decisions that had the effect of strengthening the Republican's anti-Democratic advantage. The Citizen's United ruling, their decision weakinging the Voting Rights Act, and their recent decisions to weaken unions and allow extreme Gerrymandering to stand, all help Republicans to maintain control even as the country turns increasingly against them.

The Presidency, Supreme Court and Senate are all stacked in the favor of Republicans by virtue of our system of government, but that wasn't enough for them. With Project Redmap, they used state legislatures as a weapon to shut out Democrats nationwide.  With the Citizens United ruling, they created huge networks of dark money with the help of right-wing billionaires like The Koch Brothers and the Mercers. With the Voting Rights Act gutted, Republican-controlled states were free to disenfranchise minorities through voter ID laws and voter roll purges, measures that Republicans have admitted were put in place to give them an advantage. And now House Republicans and Trump administration officials have done their best to derail an investigation into the hacking that helped Trump make it into the White House. Polls now show that voters prefer Democratic congressional candidates to Republicans by 6-8%, but even a blue wave might not be enough to retake Congress. Republicans have weaponized the government to built a bulwark against the will of the voter, one that's unprecedented in scale.

So yes. the Republicans are different.",politics,t2_qkaot,8yvtcb,e2fzgzl,/r/politics/comments/8yvtcb/elon_musk_big_gop_donor/e2fzgzl/,/r/politics/comments/8yvtcb/elon_musk_big_gop_donor/

4390,GVArcian,https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-unmasked-as-top-donor-to-house-republican-pac,">No, that's capitalism.

Exactly, capitalism is exploitation.

>This idea that socialism is the answer is a joke.

When private corporations fail, and they often do, rather than being allowed to fail they are often turned into worker-owned cooperatives that on average perform better and last longer than the private enterprises they replaced. Ergo, not only does socialism work, it is routinely saving workers from the failures of capitalism even in capitalist ""paradises"" like the US.

>In your magical universe, if I generate 1000 dollars with my labor per hour and you generate 100, we should still be paid the same in the name of equality. 

This is a strawman, and a pathetic one at that. I've made it perfectly clear that workers should be entitled to every red cent they produce. A well-educated doctor who saves society thousands in what would otherwise be lost productivity should be compensated proportionally to that effort. He should obviously not not be paid the same as the low-skilled fellow who sweeps factory floors. If you think this is what socialism or equality is, you obviously don't know what socialism or equality is.

Absolute equality, which is what you're talking about, is only possible in a post-scarcity economy. Post-scarcity means money is useless because goods and services are so abundant everyone can get them for free. Ergo, there's no point in paying workers the same wage or any wage at all because wages have been rendered meaningless by the abundance of goods and services.

Socialism is not a post-scarcity economic system. 

Thus, under socialism the only meaningful equality is equality before the law, voting equality and equality in the ownership of the means of production. The last one is sometimes called ""economic democracy"" and is basically the concept of democracy applied to the workplace (under capitalism, the workplace is autocratic, a monarchy of sorts where the CEO is king).

>That's not equality, it's you exploiting me.

In other words, it's capitalism. Capitalism is the system where those who do not work or do very little work (CEOs, shareholders, boards of directors) profit excessively from those who actually work, especially those who work hard.

Donald Trump Withdraws From Climate Deal He Says Is Unfair to U.S.
Highlights:

But some large U.S. cor­po­ra­tions op­posed the move, in­clud­ing Exxon Mo­bil Corp., Gen­eral Elec­tric Co. and Apple Inc., whose chief ex­ec­u­tives all pub­licly ar­gued in fa­vor of re­main­ing in the pact. Af­ter Mr. Trump’s an­nounce­ment, Tesla Inc. Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Elon Musk and Walt Dis­ney Co. CEO Robert Iger said they would with­draw from the pres­i­dent’s ad­vi­sory coun­cils.

Some big com­pa­nies said ex­it­ing the deal would have lit­tle im­me­di­ate im­pact on their in­vest­ments and strate­gies be­cause they are fac­ing cus­tomer and share­holder de­mands to re­duce green­house-gas emis­sions. They also op­er­ate in other coun­tries, and in U.S. states, where cli­mate rules re­main a fact of life, so they con­tinue to face gov­ern­ment pres­sure.

Sec­re­tary of State Rex Tiller­son pressed the pres­i­dent to keep the U.S. in the Paris ac­cord, as did De­fense Sec­re­tary Jim Mat­tis and lead­ers at the Pen­tagon, who have long viewed com­bat­ing cli­mate change as a mat­ter of na­tional se­cu­rity.

Al­though the fi­nal de­ci­sion re­mained in doubt right up un­til the pres­i­dent’s em­phatic state­ment Thurs­day af­ter­noon, Mr. Trump had drafted the res­o­lu­tion to with­draw from the Paris agree­ment two weeks ago, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with the in­ter­nal de­lib­er­a­tions that pit­ted Messrs. Ban­non and Pruitt against much of Mr. Trump’s eco­nomic and na­tional-se­cu­rity ad­vis­ers, as well as his own fam­ily.

The pres­i­dent’s el­der daugh­ter, Ivanka Trump , was among those who had ad­vised him to stay in the Paris agree­ment. She had suc­ceeded in get­ting her fa­ther to de­lay his de­ci­sion un­til af­ter last month’s for­eign trip so he would avoid an­tag­o­niz-ing U.S. al­lies ahead of the G-7 sum­mit and be open to their pro-ac­cord ar­gu­ments.

Rene­go­ti­at­ing the agree­ment or en­ter­ing un­der new terms could be ex­tremely dif­fi­cult in prac­tice, since nearly all na­tions agreed on the deal in 2015, and lead­ing economies have said they would con­tinue with the orig­i­nal deal if the U.S. leaves.

Other coun­tries—led by Eu­ropean na­tions—place a much higher im­por­tance on co­op­er­a­tion to curb cli­mate change, so Mr. Trump’s move could re­duce his flex­i­bil­ity in work­ing with world lead­ers, es­pe­cially if the with­drawal from the Paris agree­ment af­fects pub­lic at­ti­tude to­ward the U.S.

“It will un­der­cut the trust that other coun­tries have in the U.S. in en­ter­ing into agree­ments—trade agree­ments, agree­ments on se­cu­rity is­sues, you name it,” said David Waskow, di­rec­tor of the in­ternational cli­mate ini­tia­tive at the World Re­sources In­sti­tute, an en­vi­ron­men-tal think tank.

Back­ing away from cli­mate com­mit­ments could also shift some in­vest­ments in po­ten­tially lu­cra­tive green-en­ergy tech­nol­ogy away from the U.S. and to­ward eco­nomic ri­vals, in­clud­ing China, which pledged mas­sive in­vest­ment in re­new­able en­ergy through the pact.

The Paris ac­cord al­lowed par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries to de­ter­mine their own set of emis­sions tar­gets and plans to reach them with the broader goal of keep­ing av­er­age global tem­per­a­tures from ris­ing more than 2 de­grees Cel­sius, or 3.6 de­grees Fahren­heit, above prein­dus­trial lev­els. That level is con­sid­ered by cli­mate sci­en­tists to be the dan­ger thresh­old, be­yond which dam­age to the planet would be­come ir­re­versible.

The U.S. had pledged to cut green­house-gas emis­sions by 26% to 28% from 2005 lev­els by 2025. The U.S. is the world’s sec­ond-largest emit­ter of car­bon, be­hind China, which has reaf­firmed its own com­mit­ment to meet­ing its tar­gets un­der the Paris ac­cord.",politics,t2_4vuia,6epe74,dicf73a,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/dicf73a/,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/

Today i was listening to [a podcast that was speaking for Former Ambassador Sarah Mendelson](//np.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/6eg0i9/the_west_wing_weekly_308_the_women_of_qumar_with), who was also the director of The Human Rights Initiative. She was talking about political fights and how you react when you lose:

> It's the kind of dilemma people face often. You fight really hard for something, you lose, and then you have to ask yourself, *""Do I stay or do I go?""*
> 
> And oftentimes going doesn't necessarily result in anything. So most times people say, *""I'm gonna stay on, and fight another day.""*
> 
> **If you're not there to make the argument, it's *very* unlikely someone's going to come in and make it for you.**

It is similar to criticism that Sally Yates took after forcing the President to fire her. She may not have liked the policy; but she could have done more to help the country to swallowing hard, and living to fight another day. She could have been the deputy attorney general speaking out against the firing of the Director of the FBI. She could be pushing for the appointment of a special prosecutor. She could be holding hearings.

You should:

- stay in the room
- be a loud critic of the administration
- use your tremendous microphone to keep drawing attention to the issue

Because *if you're not there to make the argument, nobody is going to come in and make it for you.

It's worthy of discussion: was the ultimatum a good idea on his part though?  The capital for him doing this has now been spent, and didnt really net anything tangible.  That's because just about everyone - including many of Trump's supporters - know that Trump's declaration today is mostly intangible hot air.  Yes, it's a dangerous and deluded message, but Trump's actual credibility domestically and globally is near zero.  And his competence in crafting actual policy to support his delusion isn't that intimidating either.   So Musk has essential burnt his gunpowder to reinforce a message we already know, and it didn't actually win any concession.

Also most of the firings were for failures of their own/ or literally retiring from Obama's camp to move to Hillary's - at least of the ones shown.

He has now quit an advisory council I maintain that he should have never been on to begin with. Should've never given Trump the benefit of the doubt, especially after the tape.

A lot of people called for him not to be on this council because it sent the wrong message and was clearly a move by Elon to get closer to the government he probably needs to help him move further along without running into regulatory issues. Typical businesses getting unfair treatment us plebs can't enjoy. Probably good PR for Trump as well. It was a smart move for Elon, relatively.
Of course Reddit was cool with this. Claimed he'd be in a better position to force Trump's hand on important matters -- we'll see how this goes down.

Even after numerous photos of Elon Musk schmoozing with Steve Bannon and Trump, the circlejerk believed the billionaire is gonna save the world during this administration. In reality, Elon is working with the military industrial complex to score well-paying contracts firing missiles while wooing Reddit with dumb lip-service to way off ideas like AI running rampant and humans living cushy on mars. In the meantime his factories are running the engineers and workers dry, demanding every morsel of their being in return for Elon's ego stroking returns.

It's the same story over and over. Rich dude gets all the glory by abusing his workers, takes any and all loopholes, does all the same lobbying, contributing to the same systems that will keep us separated forever. But this is all worth a 30k electric car, right?
Should have called his company Edison, honestly.

**Edit**: Go ahead and downvote, y'all just keep making excuses for the lobbying, exploitative rich peeps in your heads. It's what got us Trump in the first place.

Just one more thing: Elon can imagine a beautiful future, but for some reason when it comes to workers safety the man runs out of ingenious ideas for the betterment of mankind. A nice place to work is a future he could be delivering right now... But I guess he's not that creative after all.

 The developed countries that are part of the agreement will pay TRILLIONS of dollars over the next few decades in assisting the Undeveloped countries of the world to push forward with ""clean"" energy while they grow. This is all to reduce global temperatures by .01 to .1 percent. While it may SOUND NICE to save the planet, the actual implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement will be an overwhelming drain and restriction on our resources for extremely little benefit THAT WE DONT EVEN KNOW WILL ACTUALLY WORK. Leaving the Paris Climate Agreement will uncap over 6 MILLION Jobs in America. China who (is still considered a developing country...) produces currently 30% of the global emissions can INCREASE their emissions until 2030 whilst America will be locked both industrially and in turn economically and unable to compete with China on a level playing field.

He has 100's of millions of money invested in ""green technology"".  This is about self interest.  if he really cared about the environment and really thinks this is the end of the world, then he would downsize his life.  Starting with not crisscrossing all over the world in his private jet.

When people who claim Global Warming is the end of times start living their life like it is the end of the world, then I might take them seriously.  But as long as you are living high on the hog with a carbon footprint 100X the average person, I'm not interested in what you have to say.

Besides, none of the predictions made 10-15 years ago have come true.
*The end of snow: The IPCC has warned about snowless winters. In its 2001 report, it claimed “milder winter temperatures will decrease heavy snowstorms.”  - hasn't happened*

*The melting ice caps: Another area where the warmists’ predictions have proven incorrect concerns the amount of ice at the Earth’s poles. They predicted a complete melting of the Arctic ice cap in summers that should have already happened, and even claimed that Antarctic ice was melting rapidly.*

*As far as the Antarctic is concerned, in 2007, the UN IPCC claimed the ice sheets of Antarctica “are very likely shrinking,” with Antarctica “contributing 0.2 ± 0.35 mm yr - 1 to sea level rise over the period 1993 to 2003.” The UN also claimed there was “evidence” of “accelerated loss through 2005.” In 2013, the UN doubled down on its false claim, claiming even greater sea-level rises attributed to the melting in Antarctica: “The contribution of … Antarctic ice sheets has increased since the early 1990s, partly from increased outflow induced by warming of the immediately adjacent ocean.” It also claimed Antarctica’s “contribution to sea level rise likely increased from 0.08 [ - 0.10 to 0.27] mm yr - 1 for 1992 - 2001 to .40 [0.20 to 0.61] mm yr - 1 for 2002 - 2011.” The reality was exactly the opposite.*

*In a statement released in October, NASA dropped the equivalent of a nuclear bomb on the UN’s group, noting that ice across Antarctica has been growing rapidly for decades.*

*Increased storms, drought, and sea-level rise: The ice sheets have not cooperated with predictions, and neither have other weather-related phenomena, such as mass migrations owing to sea-level rise.*

*On June 30, 1989, the Associated Press ran an article headlined: “UN Official Predicts Disaster, Says Greenhouse Effect Could Wipe Some Nations Off Map.” In the piece, the director of the UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) New York office was quoted as claiming that “entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if global warming is not reversed by the year 2000.” He also predicted “coastal flooding and crop failures” that “would create an exodus of ‘eco-refugees,’ threatening political chaos.” Of course, 2000 came and went, and none of those things actually happened.*

But Paris Agreement is not the way. It's ineffective and expansive . It involved US sending trillions to other countries with no way of enforcing what they do with the money. Biggest polluter like China and India doesn't receive free cash from US for some reason while increasing carbon emissions.

Two things can be true at once.
1. Climate change is a problem
2. Paris Agreement is hot garbage of a deal and is not the way to combat climate change.

For Trump and the Republican party, pulling out of the Paris climate agreement could be a smart move in terms of votes in future elections, because it was one of the things he campaigned on and a lot of Republican voters are climate skeptics/think it's a waste of money/live in states that produce coal. For a Republican president to come along and actually follow through with some of the ideas he campaigned on, regardless of the future implications, speaks volumes. On another note, being in the Paris agreement and not meeting the requirements has no penalties. Any of the 200 or so countries could just say they agreed to the terms, but it is more or less an honor system, and there are no consequences if obligations are not met. Hence, North Korea. They are just doing it for the pr boost, because they could use a positive nod. Tldr facing immense pressure from pretty much everyone on this planet except for the people who voted for him, Trump sides with his constituents.
