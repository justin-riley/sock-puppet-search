It might just click in his head that waterway pollution and air pollution are fundamentally similar.

But then again, it might not. My dad is a lost cause on the environmental front.

We cant reduce temperatures at all. Its too late. We already released enough pollution to raise the global average temperature. The point of the treaty is to prevent any further damage. Anything that can help should be done for our only home...

We do know it will work. The cause of global warming is obvious. The problem is solving it in thr socioeconomic system we developed. Restricted pollution is something that will work at not making the problem worse. If we want to prevent global warming we need a hell of a lot more cooperative effort. But somehow the US is too stupid to even work towards preventing damage just a little, forget implementing a solution.

There are also clsims stating staying in the treaty also makes more jobs so.... besides 6 million US jobs is more than the 7 billion people on the planet?

China is a developed country. Its a workd super power. Just because labor is cheap doesnt mean its developing... oh also the US produces more carbon than china.

We cant compete with China as it is because US wages are higher. Nothing is going to stop that. Competing with china usnt gonna help america or the world.

The point of government is to control people... we should overthrow it lol... the pount of climate comittee is to lower pollution output. It is a voluntary basis so.... yeah... and controlling all 195 countries in carbon pollution output is bad because you think the world is trying to screw america over?

Literally anybody who is as smart as Elon Musk realized early in trump's campaign that there was no way trump was going to listen to reason if he won. So Elon's choice was either to resist trump and push for rational policies outside of federal government, or to join trump's advisory team and keep on hammering trump with reason, until trump cracked or left the presidency. Even if Musk gave trump the benefit of the doubt at first, trump obliterated any notion that he would implement reasonable environmental policy as soon as he reversed the Stream Protection Rule in the first few weeks of his presidency.

The Stream Protection Rule exists for a good reason. And that reason is that when coal mining companies dump huge amounts of formerly-underground rock into streams, they are literally introducing toxic metals into the water, which negatively affect practically every living thing that the stream touches, including humans who get drinking water from the stream or any rivers it feeds. It may create a bit of extra work from the coal companies, but so fucking what? Extra work is nothing compared to the damage that comes from heavy metal pollution from unregulated coal mines.

Either the coal companies pony up a few million dollars a year to improve their dumping practices now, or the government is forced to spend billions of dollars a year for decades afterwards to treat the symptoms of heavy metal pollution in the people and the environment. There is ONLY one correct choice in that scenario, both morally and economically. I know that, you know that and Musk sure as fuck knows that, but trump went ahead and picked the wrong choice anyway. If Musk had any faith in trump's environmental policy after that moment, he's an idiot. That was the moment when Musk had to decide between leaving trump's advisory board, or staying there for he long run.",politics,t2_4vuia,6epe74,dice6nx,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/dice6nx/,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/

What sort of nonsense response is that to my comment about a guy who has:

- received ~$5 billion in government subsidies to grow his empire of companies that exist merely to exploit state tax codes to continue receiving more and more tax payer money
- attacked employees right to collectively bargain
- worked with the dumbest, fattest President to hopefully further enrich himself.

He supposedly took a ""bold stand"" today with Trump's decision on the Paris Accord? Vicious racism and policy coming from the White House since January 20th weren't enough to get him to step down from the advisory counsel?

He's a grifter. He is grifting the government and us the taxpayers to fund his company while his stocks soar, and was hoping to use his advisory position to continue to enhance his grifting operation. 

Once again, there are no good billionaires. Billionaires should absolutely not exist. We live in the most plentiful time in human history, yet a handful of people own more wealth than half of the rest of the world combined, and because of it billions all around the world suffer starvation, poverty, and death.

Customer service, cashiers, data entry, banking associates, farm labor, etc... Just about every industry is exploring massive changes as a result of automation.

We are at the precipice of a paradigm shift in terms of automation. Very large industries are at the point where they are going to be able to save themselves a ton of cash replacing workers with automated counterparts. Sure, industries have dealt with automation and technological advances before, but never on this type of scale. We're talking about huge percentages of the workforce that can be replaced in a very short amount of time. It's simply not feasible to reabsorb those types of numbers. There are going to be a lot of people who are simply going to be unnecessary and the industries that pop up are going to explore automation from the start.

These aren't freeloaders. They aren't leeches on the system. They want to work, they are just going to have obsolete skill sets facing a marketplace that's doing its damnedest to remove actual people from the equation.

If industry is exploring ways to mass automate, the government needs to be exploring ways to accommodate a labor force in a marketplace with no need for manual labor.

If you think it's CO2 levels, you're mistaken. It's really not obvious. I actually dug into this a while back and I hope that for your own peace of mind, you'll do the same. It became clear to me that there is no ""consensus"" (as we hear so often) in the scientific community regarding this phenomenon.   
  
I've seen data showing our CO2 levels 10 times as high as today during an ice age, and CO2 levels 4 times as high as today during human habitation of the planet. I've also seen charts that prove temperature and CO2 may be correlated, but in the opposite direction suggested by popular theory. As in, temperature rises first, CO2 levels go up after. The popular idea of causation is backwards, if there's any causation at all. And I've heard that atmospheric temperature change due to CO2 is logarithmic. It can't spiral out of control because it will take exponentially greater carbon emissions for each degree of global temperature change. I've heard that cloud activity contributes more to the rise and fall of global temperatures than carbon emission, and that's where some scientists are investigating.  
  
There's a lot more to it, but I guess what I'm saying is that you shouldn't be so confident that the cause is known.

He didn't think them up. He bought out the people who created them. Actually, he pretty much stole Tesla. He's not a self-made anything. He's a total fake, down to his toupee and his crazy lying girlfriend. SpaceX is a secret government project. They knew the taxpayers wouldn't support it, so they hide the funds inside the space program, when they're really helping him develop weapons. How do you think he got permission to dock with the Space Station? He's a government pawn, and once Trump cancels all his projects, he will be bust. He literally stole Tesla from it's original owner. Everybody knows that. He's a scumbag in love with a gold digger. Yeah, great guy. You can tell that by how he screwed his first wife and mother of their six (one died) kids, making her sign a ""post nup"" once PayPal started doing well that left her with next to nothing to take care of their children.

All his money, BTW, is in a trust and he lives on an allowance, because most of the money belongs to the government, not him.

Plenty more about all this in Wikipedia. If it wasn't true, he could have hired someone to go in and change it. 

>In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million from the sale of Zip2.[42][50][52] One year later, the company merged with Confinity,[51][54] which had a money transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.

In other words, it's a renewable energy paradise — and today the Central American nation is moving quickly to become a green energy powerhouse. Within a few years the vast majority of Nicaragua's electricity will come from hydroelectric dams, geothermal plants and wind farms.

The reason they didn't join the Paris Climate Accord:

> In the case of Nicaragua, the argument actually went the other way. As world leaders gathered in the French capital in November 2015 to reach an agreement on fighting climate change, Nicaragua's lead envoy explained to reporters that the country would not support the agreed-upon plan as it hinged on voluntary pledges and would not punish those who failed to meet them. That was simply not enough, Paul Oquist argued.

>  “We’re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure,” Oquist told the website Climate Home on Nov. 30. “We don’t want to be an accomplice to taking the world to 3 to 4 degrees and the death and destruction that represents.”

> After the coup, Pinochet’s soldiers rounded up Chileans who were believed to be involved with leftist groups, including Allende’s Popular Unity party. On the morning of 12 September 1973, Jara was taken prisoner, along with thousands of others, and interned in Chile Stadium. The guards there tortured him, smashing his hands and fingers, and then mocked him by asking him to play the guitar.

I don't know where you got that misinformation on Reagan-era Nicaragua but it was NOT ""chill"".  The real McCoy communists who filtered into Nicaragua during that revolution killed a lot of innocent people and later attempted to destabilize the rest of Central America through similarly violent upheaval.  You have no idea who and what you slapped a halo on there.

I'm not suggesting that Nicaragua's former President and his inner circle were choir boys.  They weren't.  They definitely deserved to be overthrown.  Instead, I'm pointing out that many of the Communist radicals found in Nicaragua were as bad if not worse in many instances.  Sandinistas screwed the Nicaraguan people too.  I take it you were unaware that Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega also pilfered from that country's treasury.  Here's [Ortega's boomerang ""evolution"" into the very autocrats he fought to replace](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/4/daniel-ortega-is-a-sandinista-in-name-only.html).

BTW, I'm no Reagan fan, but he was correct to take on the Communists who attempted to destabilize Central and South America.  I've seen what communist revolutionaries are capable of doing.  Would you like a peek?  Look no further than what they're doing to the people of Venezuela in their equally blind and self-serving lust for power.

As far as Trump's arguments, none of them really hold any water. On the one hand you have the fact that the renewable energy sector is growing at such a rapid pace, I haven't looked up numbers but it wouldn't surprise me if it outpaced whatever estimates Trump's talking points are relying on, especially as investment continues to increase. Then on the other hand you have the fact that this whole thing was voluntary and had zero consequences attached to not meeting the *voluntary* goals that the country set *for itself*.

now, do you have any supporting creds to back up claims?

How does/will Paris Accord hurt the country - on the one hand turmpists claim it is toothless and not worth participating in, on the other there appears to be  a continget that that believes it, ( the PA ) is killing jobs and maybe making the US weaker... or costing too much... REally, this line of though is fuzzy at best, maybe on purpose...

Next question would be job loss, some site 2.7 million. Really, whre is that coming from? From my view, new jobs are and will be created that focus on new tech/energy. And over time that/those will only grow if they are successfull. HOw is that not the american way. cheat answer - it is the american way.

Not signing up the the PA puts the US in a position of isolationism, and foolishnes. THe PA is hardly constricting in it's requirments,  it's an 'agreement' for fs. 

When playing the game, being at the table is one of the most important positions. Taking toys home and saying no, leveing the rest of the worlld at the table is just foolish.

We all know the PA is somewhat pointless, but still it is not. That's what makes it great, it 's a start on the road, and everyone needs a truck on that road....

Going it alone is foolish, how many times can I sy this.. Just gets tiring. Goining it along works for loners in the woods, not nations, sitting at a table.

> Paul Oquist, Nicaragua's representative at the 2015 talks in Paris, has called the climate deal a ""path to failure."" One of the primary reasons is that **the deal is not binding** — in other words, **there are no punishments** for countries that fail to live up to the commitments they make as part of the deal [...] Oquist also objected to the agreed-upon goal of **limiting the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius**, noting that the emissions targets, as well as the voluntary nature of the agreement, **would likely result in increases of more like 3 or 4 degrees Celsius** [...] ""It’s a matter of the developing countries surviving.

We were handing out $3 billion to a Green Climate Fund. And we had pledged to contribute towards a global $100 billion fund to help poor countries, but this is spread across *way* more countries than just the US, and includes foreign aid and private sector investments we probably would have made anyway.

Finally, no one forced us. All this was entirely voluntary because it made sense for the US from a lot of angles (technology, trade, diplomacy, national security, and humanitarian aid).

The national security implications of climate change alone should be reason enough to support the Paris agreement.

To be fair, Putin has more direct dealings with Muslim populations and neighbors and learned a lot of the psychology of terrorism.  Distance-learning, and the draw of fast exciting events by the media-addicted American public.

We've let ourselves stay in a State of Emergency for 16 years, and Trump's first big play in office was to go after the Muslims via airport closure and visa revocations. Clearly Trump thinks being scared and Fear is the way to deal with the Islam problems the world is having.

Conservative Muslims and Conservative Communists are very good at defeating the moral of liberal arts and free thinking.  They understand just how powerful it is to emphasize short-term reaction in the minds of the people.

As for no good billionaires, I think that's a bit of a hasty generalization. I would agree with you for 99% of them because they have all this money and power but are either completely useless or corrupt. Musk is a 1%. Yes, he does have a very privileged existence but keep in mind he started a couple companies prior to the grant. He demonstrated merit and was rewarded for it and rather than just hermit up or try to take control, he's using that money to keep innovating. In the current societal climate where personal responsibility is replaced with blaming others for one's problems, he continues to try and improve where he can.

Take Tesla, for example. He took a grant to make a limited number of cars and said within a set number of years the money made would be put towards a newer, better, and more affordable car. He did it, and then made the same plan for another line which is set to cone out this year. The initial Tesla S came out at 90k and the upcoming model is supposed to be a top of the line electric car for 30k.

I understand healthcare is different, and that some people are born with illnesses out of their control. And I do feel bad for them. At the same time, its not fair to me or insurance companies to be forced to pay for their medical care. Sometimes people are born unlucky.

Now, if charities that are subsidized by the government are set up to help these people, thats something I'd get behind (and support). Others helping others *voluntarily* is a good thing.

This agreement is literally a foreign exchange brokerage of ""futures of pollution"" instead of ""futures of delivery of commodities"", forcing America and the European countries respective companies to have to pay for the right to pollute, thus acting as  tax. Mind you, a tax that they could easily avoid by outsourcing to third world countries.

This agreement was and is a mechanism that incentivuze companies to outsource, and create EVEN MORE pollution than what they would create in the host country. 

Do you want to lose American jobs to Mexico, while bringing the pollution to Mexico too?

It doesn't address pollution, and in an ironic sense it outsources pollution to poor countries that have less of a chance at avoiding it or cleaning it up later. 

Is that what you want? Have you read any fair criticism of it yet? No, you haven't. You don't have time to, and your selected media isn't showing it to you. If they do, they would not do a decent job at criticising it because that would offend or hurt their own audience.

If you want to put African Americans out of work, pollute countries so poor and unable to maintain themselves, thus allowing the world to rot even further, then you are a racist liberal who virtue signals instead if thinks, who yells instead of reads, and your own policies hurt the people you pretend to care so much about: yourself.",politics,t2_4vuia,6epe74,dicbm85,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/dicbm85/,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/

And since you haven't been paying attention to energy markets for the last several years, allow me to explain that regulation isn't prohibiting oil production.

That's because OPEC has kept production high, in order to drive down the price of oil to make it harder for American producers to compete.  American oil is more expensive to recover - not because of regulation, but because the drilling & recovery processes required to get it out of the ground make it more expensive to produce than Saudi oil.

That was simply not enough, Paul Oquist argued.

In other words, it's a renewable energy paradise — and today the Central American nation is moving quickly to become a green energy powerhouse.

this is basically the story of Latin America -- exploited for centuries by European nations as colonies, then after gaining independence, turned over to US/western-backed puppet dictators who refused to nationalize industries or institute economic reforms to allow American/western companies to continue to exploit their natural resources. 

It's why Cuba is the thorn in the side of imperialism/colonialism -- Castro (whatever his faults re: political prisoners and suppression of dissenters) successfully kept a country fed, clothed, and educated without any real material support from allies, on an island nation isolated from its closest neighboring mainland. While other Latin American nations may have fared better or worse with socialism (Venezuela is a notable failure due to Chavez's cult of personality, but Bolivia and Uruguay stand out as well-functioning democracies with significant numbers of leftists/socialists in government, and somehow that never gets much press in the States), but it cannot be argued that repressive, right-wing governments in Latin America have any better track record, e.g., Pinochet or Peron.

Not that climate change is real but that this agreement favors other countries who have been doing wrong for longer when it comes to emissions and what not way and basically acutally hurts us moneywise.

People want to talk shit but I bet his reasons aren't horrible.  I bet once they begin to come out people will see the rational side to things and understand that Obama didn't care and just wanted to look cool and awesome to younger generations rather than fighting for his countrymen.

So basically this is going to play out over a lot longer time and I can't wait to see what the reasoning he has behind everything and if any are valid.  I am betting some will be but it won't matter on the hate subs like politics and what not but I would like to know the reasons from a non partisan website and everyone seems to throw opinions in nowadays on their articles and I am over it.

Yeah, the wife of a former president just randomly popped up out of a population of 300 million right?

Hillary started her political influence and political career under Bill Clintons presidency, just like Trumps relatives have. She has been using the Clinton brand for everything it's worth.

The leaks from the Democratic party with regards to excluding Bernie do not show any illegalities.

However they do reveal a significant amount of cronyism and shows very clearly that the Democrats are indeed a closed club who want to use their ticket to 50% of the American democracy for their internal purposes. They are not interested in a fair, democratic process including people who have not climbed the internal ladders of the Democrats.

In reality that means that the internal hierarchy of the Democrats ""owns"" 50% of the American democracy, more or less.

**USA:** 26-28% domestic reduction in greenhouse gases by 2025 compared to 2005, making its best effort to reach the 28% target. This includes the land sector and excludes international credits at this time. Carbon Brief has a more detailed article on the US INDC.


**China:**  A peak in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, with best efforts to peak earlier. China has also pledged to source 20% of its energy from low-carbon sources by 2030 and to cut emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65% of 2005 levels by 2030, potentially putting it on course to peak by 2027.


**India:** A 33-35% reduction in emissions intensity by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. Also pledges to achieve 40% of cumulative electricity installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based resources by 2030. Will also increase tree cover, creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2030. India intends to cover the $2.5 trillion cost of its pledge with both domestic and international funds. Includes information on adaptation.

Never forget that trump made a conscious choice to increase the levels of heavy metal pollution from coal mining, just so that coal companies can make a slightly higher profit and maybe employ a few more people. The number of people employed by the coal mining industry in the US went from nearly a million in 1920 to 80,000 today, and the vast majority of that decline happened long before any significant environmental regulations were enacted. And yet a moronic fuckhole like trump has the gall to confidently state that he's going to bring back the coal jobs by repealing regulations.

I can't help but be cynical about Musk's motivation for leaving the advisory panel now. If he truly thought he could talk sense into trump about environmental policy, he was definitively proven wrong in February. So his choice was to leave the advisory panel at that point, or to stay in it for the long haul, and keep on trying to beat sense into trump's thick head until trump left the presidency. Instead of making either of those choices, Musk decided to stay on the panel until trump inevitably decided to withdraw from the Paris Accord, which maximized the good PR he could get by announcing that he would leave.

Many of them could actually make more money and have more stable jobs if they leave climate science and go into other fields that they are qualified in.

I know it might seem quaint, but at the most fundamental level, science is the search for objective truth, and it is by far the most rigorous method for doing so. People who dedicate their lives to esoteric, data-driven science are not the type of people who would sell their souls for an unstable, low-paying job like the kind they get as a climate scientist.

If your argument is just that its human decency, then I really just can't agree. Its also human decency to not force others into providing for you. Again, I think charity funding for pre-exisiting conditions would be awesome. I really think that with less regulations drug companies could reduce costs overall and lead toward the point where you don't actually need a ton of insurance.

Now, don't get me wrong- some of the Afghans were just as bad as Bin Laden, such as [Gulbuddin Hekmatyar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulbuddin_Hekmatyar). But some of them were goddamn heroes, like [Abdul Haq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Haq_(Afghan_leader)).

There's plenty of evidence that ""foreign economic policy"" wasn't a major factor in post-independence economic performance, at least for Brazil. Too bad my references are all in Portuguese, but I can show them anyway.

> It's why Cuba is the thorn in the side of imperialism/colonialism -- Castro (whatever his faults re: political prisoners and suppression of dissenters) successfully kept a country fed, clothed, and educated without any real material support from allies, on an island nation isolated from its closest neighboring mainland.

False in two different ways: Cuba was already by far the richest Latin American country before the Revolution. Castro destroyed the sugar industry and started to rely on USSR grants instead. After the USSR collapsed, well, Cuba almost collapsed (this is directly connected to the Balseros crisis) and from that day on the country has terrible, terrible standards of living, living on small grants from other left-wing Latin American governments.

> Bolivia and Uruguay stand out as well-functioning democracies with significant numbers of leftists/socialists in government

Completely different models. Bolivia (and especially Ecuador, for that matter) are Venezuelan puppets. They're just as poor as they were before those governments took over. Uruguay is a pretty well-managed Social Democracy with little formal/ideological ties to Venezuela.

> but it cannot be argued that repressive, right-wing governments in Latin America have any better track record, e.g., Pinochet or Peron.

Perón wasn't even close to being right-wing. His party was named ""Justicialista"" after ""Social Justice"". He's one of the worst socialist-ish authoritarian Latin American presidents you can find, together with scum like Chávez, Vargas and Allende - all democratically ""elected"" (Vargas was a dictator for more that 13 years and Allende was only elected because Chile had no 2nd round mechanism back then, but anyway), all authoritarian hijos de puta.",politics,t2_4vuia,6epe74,dichj4q,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/dichj4q/,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/

Here they have a coal power plant, and methane siphoned out of the nearby garbage dump right next to it, and you can request your power come from the latter. They don't *actually* have separate grids for the two energy sources, but they do increase the percentage that comes from the siphoned methane proportional to the percentage of people who request it. Obviously natural gas isn't great, especially compared to some places out west where wind or hydro is Dominion's renewable option. But it's exponentially better than coal, and converting methane that would've been released into the atmosphere anyway to the 20x less potent warming agent Carbon Dioxide by burning it is still a win for the environment.",politics,t2_4vuia,6epe74,dicj2h3,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/dicj2h3/,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/

But you can also do this by shifting money from other programs such as military spending rather than a much needed climate change program. I agree that its not convenient that we have to fund so much money, but ultimately we are doing it for the sake of global health and for humanitarian reasons. 

My concern is the consequences of not joining this agreement. The climate change agreement also insists on a climate tax in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. With the EPA losing control and with the U.S. pulling out of the climate agreement, there are far less regulations on business pollution. We have a firsthand example of what happens when business pollution gets out of hand (China).

This all sounds great if you're thinking about today only, and today's climate topic.  

But as a general rule that the politicians (and by extension, government and citizens) should just obey scientists is an idea that's also fraught with risks.

Science, including ""consensus"" science, is sometimes wrong or incomplete.  Further, science as an industry is comingled with economic and industrial and corporate interests and money. 

Imagine the same rule being applied in the mid-20th century when doctors were endorsing certain brands of cigarettes.  Should the politicians/people just obey whatever Monsanto's staff of well-compensated scientists tell us?  

There should be checks and balances both ways, and merely saying that politicians/civilians should always take their orders from scientists isn't balanced.

The dude is fucking setting himself up for 2020 and liberals are so blind in their hatred for Trump they'll fall for his charade.

Don't get me wrong, I despise Trump, but I'm sick of seeing liberals rally behind awful people they should oppose. A lot of these people aren't against Trump because of ethical reasons; they're against him because he harms their political or economic interests.

Also not only do I think it is real I think that no matter what the stones have started rolling down the hill and there is no stopping them so we should be gutting the planet as much as we can and living with as many resources as possible and pulling as much money out before we die.

The permafrost melting can't be refroze.  This is what causes sea life to die and when the oceans go bye bye humans.

No other country will take a hit like that and most will actually receive benefits from the agreement compared to us.

How is that fair?  We kept out population low.  We aren't the sole cause.

Nations going through their theoretical industrial revolutions(170-200 years late) while the population is doubling from 3.5 bil to 7 billion is the reason for this.  More people being born are the reason for this.  Keeping up with demand to meet all of the new mouths in countries with shit populations and out of control numbers are the reason.

This is like cancelling the TPP.  Once people start to do actual research and see it for more than Ah Trump do something We no like when Trump do anything good or bad.  We yell now.  It will get better.

Hillary has also been using the Clinton brand for everything it's worth. The ties between presidency, economy, networking and cronyism have been extremely strong and are well documented.

Hillary didn't just randomly get ""chosen"" as the best of hundreds of million people as the Democrat candidate.

You can of course argue that she at least worked hard for it, but on the other hand, Hillary actually became the Democrat presidential candidate, which despite the ""slightly lesser amount of nepotism"" is still very serious.

Survey data says your anecdotal evidence is wrong.

Interestingly enough, catholic seems to have no bias either way. Protestants are more likely(relative to the population) to be republican, and mormons and evangelical protestants lean heavily towards being protestants, while most other religions are all more likely to lean dem, with jehovahs witnesses as an interesting anomaly that tend to have no preference(guessing it must be part of their beliefs or something?)

GOPers also have the smallest proportion of people who ""do not believe in god""(so atheist)

Furthermore, pulling out of this agreement has the potential to spark a trade tax. If other nations charge a carbon tax on U.S. energy exports such as coal, this will negatively affect our GDP.

Technology regarding renewable energy has been steadily improving while also lowering the cost of switching to renewable energy. While at the present moment, it may be more expensive to switch, I think the benefits of environmental health outweigh the costs in the long run. I am not saying that every family needs to switch to renewable energy because I understand the financial constraints. However, the carbon emissions limit and tax implied in the agreement if primarily aimed at businesses and I believe that  businesses could definitely make use of renewable energy more.

It's how they were brought up and they will teach their children the same twisted shit if they even survive.

1. make the US a world leader in the cutting-edge green energy production market

2. reduce its reliance on foreign energy (oil!), thereby making America more self-reliant

3. stabilize the Middle East by reducing outside economic interests/pressure (said oil!)

4. put pressure on *certain* oil-wealthy enablers of terrorism and frequent human rights violators

5. hit the economy of a certain oil-dependent geopolitical rival by lowering the demand/price of oil

6. reduce and stabilize America's long-term energy costs by relying on sustainable energy

7. create thousands (millions?) of jobs in a whole new green energy industry that is sure to last

8. help clean the air (don't underestimate this one)

In other words, bigger government is required to enforce the greater degree of regulation. Bigger government means bigger budgets and higher taxes. More simply doesn't mean better.

Its silly and hypocritical only if you were completely unable to parse out my point. I asked you what dictator supported by the US since the fall of saddam is worse than saddam. I asked this because Saddam was arguably the worst dictator the US has ever supported, and his crimes have been unmatched by any US supported regime since.

In other words, you seem to have taken my critical analysis of how bad saddam was in comparison to other us supported regimes as some kind of blanket defense of us foreign policy in general. Take another read at my two other comments and ask yourself if that is even implied.

Castillo Armas, guilty of genocide and killing hundreds of thousands of Guatamalans

El Salvador, 70000 killed by US backed and trained govt forces

Syngman Rhee, South Korea, instilled against the will of the people, liked 100000+ dissenters and arguably partially responsible for the Korean War

Killed half a million Cambodians in illegal bombings to help pave the way for the Khmer Rouge, who ended up killing two million Cambodians people. After communist Vietnam drove them out (a nation that just had millions of its citizens killed by the US for trying to overthrow a western backed colonial oppressor...) The US continued to provide aid to the soldiers responsible afterwards, trained them in laying the millions of land mines that still kill and maim people today. 

Then look at the destabilising done in Syria and Libya, every African nation that moves towards stability, the funding of Pakistan Turkey and Saudi, the world's biggest sponsors of terrorism. The Mexican cartels, the heroin trade in Afghanistan and across the world.

The US isn't able to get astronauts into space right now and missions are launched form Kasakhstan, using a russian vehicle. SpaceX is working on a US vehicle to explore space and reach Mars, also capable of servicing the ISS.

Other incentives he gets are used by GM (cars) and other solar companies, too.

The hilarious thing is that **Musk** wasn't born in the US, but has faith in the country and therefore **builds his new factories in the US and creates jobs in the US**

How can you be against this business model?

This will happen if the fascism route is taken or if there isn't enough left to support fascism.  Fascism can be viewed as oligarchy by force.

Oligarchies collapse because they divert too many resources away from productive parts of society and to the unproductive top 1% or .01%.

3030,mister_ghost,http://qz.com/844425/fake-news-is-the-newest-strategy-for-taking-down-elon-musk-tesla-tsla-and-solarcity/,">Many of the attacks on Musk begin with something factual: His businesses were built, legally, with the help of billions in government contracts and incentives for renewable energy and space transport. But they go on to accuse Musk of fraud and wasting taxpayer dollars; some compare him to a convicted felon. At least three conservative sites have run negative pieces about Musk—by a nonexistent writer named “Shepard Stewart”—that include “Elon Musk Continues to Blow Up Taxpayer Money With Falcon 9” and “Elon Musk: Faux Free Marketeer and National Disgrace.” Two later retracted the stories.

Okay, but where's the lie?

Saying that he's taken advantage of government subsidies is not a lie, per the piece's own admission. Saying the subsidies are a waste of money is not a lie, it's clearly a statement of opinion. Saying someone is ""like Bernie Madoff or Sanders"" is once again a statement of opinion, claiming that there's no return on the money they're given.

So that leaves us with ""accuses him of fraud"". The only instance I could find of that was

>Already grossly subsidized, Musk’s SolarCity has become an albatross of waste, fraud, and abuse of tax payer dollars

Goes on to describe SolarCity (run by Musk's cousins) failing to meet profit goals and posting losses. Tesla (not Musk) bought the company, meaning that Tesla shareholders absorbed part of SC's losses. The author then says that this smells like foul play - having your publicly traded company buy out your cousin's non-profitable company does raise some eyebrows, to be sure.

So saying that SC is ""an albatross of waste, fraud, and abuse of tax payer dollars"" is certainly tipping your editorial hand, but that doesn't make it ""fake news"". Anyone reading the piece would understand that the sentence referred to the paragraphs that followed it.

To be fair, the deleted articles are deleted and I can't say what was in them. But the headline said fake news, and the worst I see in here is ""they said he was wasting taxpayer money and called a business decision that they thought was sketchy fraud"". If these are the flagship fake news items, I'm not buying it.

Perhaps

**With Hillary Clinton out of the way, right-wing and ~~fake~~ rude news writers are going after Elon Musk instead**

There have always been misinformation campaigns for or against various things or issues. But with effectiveness of fake news sites I wonder if companies/individuals will take this further than Hilary. the article suggests that but I wonder how far it will go. Clearly Musk is competing with a lot of companies and disrupting a few very big industries. I'm sure there are people he's competing with that would like to see him go down in flames. 

I think the pizzgate story is also a good example of how to rile up a base. The trump section of America doesn't seem to trust any actual  credible news sources. Idk, kind of scary to think about.

3267,JoshuaZ1,http://qz.com/844425/fake-news-is-the-newest-strategy-for-taking-down-elon-musk-tesla-tsla-and-solarcity/,"Musk has stayed pretty apolitical, and has never expressed interest in running for office. There appear to be five possible major motivations for this action (listed here from most likely to least likely in my estimation):

First,  the people behind this are simply hateful and without a major target like Hillary must choose another.

Second, they hate Musk because much of his work (electric cars, solar cells, even wanting to use methane for rockets because methane is a potentially renewable resource) has been to deal with issues related to global warming. If the second is the motivator, then it says something really fascinating: that there are elements of the right which not only are convinced that global warming is some sort of evil hoax, but that they actively hate people who disagree with them and are trying to take steps to destroy someone who is trying to help. If that's the case, it is truly a frightening example of the depth that people can sink to, and the levels they'll go to not just ignore facts they don't like but to actively try to harm people who try to deal with those factual issues.

Third, there is a fair bit of evidence of Russian meddling in this election and that some of the anti-Hillary propaganda came from Russian sources to try to push the election to the candidate they favored. By the same token, Musk is potentially a real danger to Russian interests, since Russia is heavily oil dependent and also has an advantage when the US is dependent on Russia for manned space launches. If they have the now existing resources and hooks into the US public, then using it to harm Musk is a natural thing.

Fourth, the same tendencies that give rise to fascism frequently lead to anti-intellectualism, and in that context Musk is a natural target.

Fifth, this may be in part being pushed by those who see Tesla and Solar City as endangering their bottom line (e.g. oil and gas companies).

We could maybe get back the first 30% or so of production back to the levels we were at 10 or 15 years ago.  (Employment gains would be proportionally less due to better mechanization of production.)  But anything much beyond that would require Soviet-style ""fuck the market, this is a command economy, so we'll dig up coal here and bury it in a hole there"" type stuff.

We simply don't have enough coal burning power plants to consume much more than we dig out of the ground now.  There's also the issue that there are several different types of coal, and a given power plant can only operate on one type.  We have actively shut down a lot of coal power plants, and taken many others and ripped out the coal burning parts and replaced them to burn natural gas, for example.

There is some export/international market for coal.  Australia is currently the largest global exporter, but to gain market share we'd be competing with the likes of Indonesia and Russia where ""regulation"" and ""paying employees a living wage"" aren't big issues.  (Note how much closer those sources are to the big consumers - China and India...  Also, the infrastructure to offload millions of tons of coal from trains and onto boats isn't something you quadruple in 6 months.)

*Maybe* Trump will be able increase US coal production by 20% over several years, and get back something like 10,000 direct coal mining jobs mostly in Wyoming (West Virginia and PA coal country gets shafted again.)

3455,None,http://qz.com/844425/fake-news-is-the-newest-strategy-for-taking-down-elon-musk-tesla-tsla-and-solarcity/,"Its AI that is the main fuel for automation. Take every machine and make it smarter. Take every electronic device and make it do more. Once you develop the AI the cost to distribute it are neglicable.

Robotics are an important extension of AI and automation, but the driving force is basically data analysis and data collection. 

We have too much data these days and to unlock the potential of data at a much faster rate we will us AI even in academic progressions. AI will be able to read every academic paper for ever written on a subject in minutes or seconds and it will reliably find patterns that teams of humans would spend lifetimes not finding. 

AI or more accurately machine learning lets a robotic hand able to grasp things by learning. Years ago we would have to try to program ever possible object into the machine, which is fairly impossible. Now the machine can work on a set of rules to achieve a set of goals and remember exactly how it 'solved' each program.

Right now I read we will lose 1 million jobs per year to automation and I suspect as AI gets flushed out that per year loss number will rise. Large chunks of industry will get targeted and come under enormous pressure as workers effectively know automation is in their industry and going to replace their job. 

Self driving cars are the ideal example. What seems like a novel consumer technology will rapidly expand to replace taxi drivers, truck drivers and eventually delivery drivers and that's a lot of millions of workers with just one major AI application. 

House cleaning, landscaping are prime targets. Factory works has always been a prime target for automation. Twinkie was brought back to life by automating away 93% of the workforce with modern machinery and software. 

Some industries will automate more than others, not all will lose 93% of their workforce, but I suspect most will effectively lose 90% of their workforce, but MOST only means 51% in my world. 

If I was a corporation looking at investing in automation, but scared of the costs and you gave me tax breaks. I would use those tax breaks to automate and then fire my unneeded workers, but of course I would not talk about it until everything was ready to go because we can't have workers revolting or anything. That wouldn't be fair to the stockholder. 

Tax breaks or even wage increases, none of that is going to offset automation loses and this is just the start. The lowest skilled workers will generally go first, but office workers are not safe either. Customers representative work, tech support and even some sales are not safe. 

On the other hand some sales jobs will be very safe because AI will not be able smooze and flatter anytime soon, if there is anybody left with money to buy things...

Professions which primarily require empathy and emotional connections may do better, sales, marketing and entertainment will probably not feel nearly as much heat from automation as manufacturing a service work. 

Trusted progressions like police, firefighters, healthcare in general, security in general will not get automated as much. Teaching will not get automated. Construction and other dangerous but fine work will not get automated very quickly because it's very situationally based and AI will take time and teaching to get to the point we can trust it to do those things. 

I imagine we will train robots to do jobs more so than program them. Once you have good learning software and basic movement, commands and general awareness of it's environment, you could just basically use the old monkey see monkey do strategy. This is a top reason to make humanoid robots, so they can use all our existing tools and so if they all fail we still have our existing tools.

Instead of making a self driving riding lawnmower, make a robot that can use a lawnmower. Instead of a self driving drump truck, make a robot that can drive said truck and mass the produce the hell out of it.

That's the smart and modular model on how to do it I think. Every home gets a robot and that one robot can effectively automate everything because it's humanoid shaped and sized. Shovels, axes, power tools, you don't build that into the robot, you just make a robot that can use them. It's cheaper that way too. Industrial robots may be a different story. It may be worth the extra money and propriety to design them specific to their purpose.

Fossil fuel doesn't matter much because solar is at or below the cost of coal per kilowatt. Oil has to stay around until lithium can catch up, we should stop attacking oil and just push lithium and let the market do the job. It's faster, smarter and creates less backlash.

Attacking fossil fuel tends to polarize people. Pushing for awesome batteries does not. 

We have to consider the cost of victories, not just winning. Sometimes going head on at a problem under the premise you are doing the right thing winds up having a less ideal effect than ignoring the issue and approaching it from a differeng angle.

It's kind of like hunting. You don't just run down your prey because that's what you want and it's the shortest path to what you want. You gotta zig zag, cover your scent, think about the variables like wind and noise, color contrasts. You don't just run right at the problem and expect that to be the easy way.

You have to trick the 'problem' into coming to your or solving itself or find a way to approach it from an angle that does not alert it to your intentions. 

This is all because at the end of the day human behavior will always be the biggest obstacle to anything, so every solution should take into account how people will react 1,5, and 10 years down the road.

Too often we don't consider backlash and the new impact is to slow progress. You wind up with a big victory and then 50 years of paybacks and that's often a net loss to approaching the problem with more tactful strategy that takes into account human behavior.

You catch more lies with honey and you get more done with cooperation, even if you have to zig zag to get there, your pace of travel and overall progress will make up for your extended path.

Fortunately, it seems that journalism ""solved"" it themselves by setting standards. 

Now it seems we're going through another wave of yellow journalism with the internet revolution. Unfortunately, I have no idea how you can solve this now when journalistic standards are already established and people still don't trust it over Infowars.

There's no easy solution to this because of Western ideals on freedom of the press. 

The way I'm looking at this is that there is an ""information economy"" made up of various actors producing and selling information, and just like real markets, you're going to have unscrupulous businesses selling garbage, e.g., if I didn't need a business license or have government agencies watching over me, I could start selling ""protein bars"" from my garage made up of apple cores and old newspaper.

Regulation was the key there, but any attempt to regulate information itself is going to be met with resistance due to our Western ideals. How is this done without censorship? Who will be the regulators? Should it be the government or can it be self-regulatory in some way, like standards organizations?

I feel like educated, successful middleclass people - the ones who actually run our western societiesies - are kinda quiet in the political discourse. No opinions, no convictions, people are silent out of fear of being wrong and fear of being victim of the anger of those perpetually angry people.

Last year the whole refugee thing was making people all sorts of emotional in my country. I work at a huge government org and know many people who organised the whole mass immigration thing. Not once did I hear an opinion what politics should do in this situation. Once my boss said ""I don't really know what to make of it!"" and that's pretty much what most people I know think.

On the other hand, go on Facebook, find a person who has never seen a university from the inside, look through their history and you immediately know their stance on politics.

TLDR: Media market means consolidation, and internet means very few firms survive. Worse - click bait is easier to sell, and we've gotten too good at emotion manipulation. The media is dead, reviving it is the wrong direction)

------
You dont combat it alone

1) America puts a cap on campaign spending - NOW. (this is a better target than attempting to fix media. And as does America, hopefully more parts of the world follow)

2) Government paid neutral/arms length news agencies like the BBC, just to force people like fox and others to have to fight to justify their bias

Honestly though - theres no way the media can fight it, and the american scenario just makes it worse

Media houses have been on terminal decline ever since the internet ""DEMOCRATIZED INFORMATION GATHERING!"", which we now realize was the inadvertent paupering of editors who could exercise oversight. 

Yes - not all editors were excellent, and usually the removal of a legacy service with a new service is an efficiency improvement.

*BUT*

Only a small fraction of human beings actually choose to find information that goes contrary to biases *they know they have*. (forget searching for counter information on biases they dont know they have).

In the old market, an editorial board could in theory act as that barrier or provider of perspective. And at least it was manned by people who tended to take their role seriously and had cultural/professional heroes who gave them a standard to follow.

It didn't make everyone happy - but thats the point. As people in T_D are happy to remind others when things are in their favor ""you are sad because the facts don't make you happy""


Unfortunately in the market scenario, the market is incentivized to give people what they *really* want. i.e.: emotions.

Add to this mess the historical consolidation trend in the industry (meaning eventually a business house ends up owning a news paper)

And then consider that print media has been decimated, and that even news sites are in trouble because of ad blockers - and you realize that we've happily walked into a mess which we may never get out of.

The alternatives which we have to the fourth estate don't cut it. Worse - technology allows people to completely cut out the fact checking aspect of society and go straight to programming webpages to trigger emotions and thus action.

We need to break the skinner box.

This is a reason why we're so dependent on HB1. Granted it's a trickle right now but it could soon be a flood.

Anecdotal evidence: My partner has been looking abroad for graduate school for some time now. He is already saddled with debt (student loan and medical), so he refuses to add to it. If we went abroad, we'd likely not come back. It would depend on the market. Academic markets are pretty bad everywhere, but it's horrific in the US due to the lack of social services. And now we have an education privatization zealot appointed to the DOE.

Personally, I am watching the situation with the EPA closely. If it's gutted, I will likely have to leave the country if I want to keep working in my field. It's true that I could just try to weather the storm until regulation is restored, but unfortunately I'm reaching the time of my life where I have to think about what I really want over the next 10 years. It's about that time I think about starting a family and the next career step, etc. I'm in my 30s, and while I could maybe afford to wait until my late 40s, that's asking a lot. A potential 8 years of Republican deregulation combined with their disastrous social policies would obliterate my life plans.

The idea that liberals are ""smart"" and conservatives are ""stupid"" is what's known as the Dunning-Kruger effect.  The average laymen (of either side) doesn't know enough about history or politics to have an informed position on the matter (or a certainty of confidence thereof).

tl;dr; uneducated liberals are so uneducated that they're not aware of what they don't know so they assume they know all there is to know because a 30 second clip from a funny-man show told them so.

Don't get me wrong I like John Oliver et al. but they're not unbiased, telling the truth, or really that helpful.

For instance, in the last Canadian Election John Oliver did a stunt where he threw $5000 in the air because that's the fine for a foreigner interfering in our elections.   He tried to make it sound like Harper (the former Conservative) enacted that law.  Except it wasn't.  Paul Martin (a Liberal) enacted the law 3 years before Harper got his first minority.  John Oliver routinely glosses over facts and both sides of every story.

For instance, in his episode on bail/fines he had sob stories of drivers fined $30 who then snow balled into $100s in fines/fees/etc.  But he neglects to admit that the germ of their problems were unsafe driving practices, etc...

3538,sflicht,http://qz.com/844425/fake-news-is-the-newest-strategy-for-taking-down-elon-musk-tesla-tsla-and-solarcity/,"First of all, the QZ article is pretty lame -- I'd qualify it as fake news, and certainly fake journalism, since it's just rewriting a Bloomberg report. The headline suggests some sort of ""switch in focus"" from HRC to Elon, which is not justified by anything in the article or its sources. As a high profile technologist, Musk has had vocal supporters and vocal critics for years.

Second, I don't think any of examples they link to are actually examples of fake news. For example [this](http://dailysignal.com/2016/11/13/its-time-to-stop-spending-taxpayer-dollars-on-elon-musk-and-cronyism/) is just an opinion piece, expressing a common skepticism about Musk's business acumen and whether he would have succeeded in a more *laisse faire* economy. The argument that solar subsidies are a poor use of taxpayer dollars is a coherent one, and likewise for EV subsidies. Tesla and Solar City are among the most high-profile companies benefiting from these policies, so they're naturally a focal point for political debate about the merits of the policies.

With that let me turn to your putative explanations:

1. The people who criticize Musk aren't just ""hateful types"" seeking a new target after the election, because the chronology doesn't bear that out. Rather, I think they're mostly motivated by the politics of the particular issues they're interested in.

2. This is overblown. There is a world of difference between ""the solar and electric vehicle industries have reaped the benefits from large amounts of government subsidies"" (which is true) and ""global warming is an evil hoax"". Many people believe in the existence of AGW but don't think these sorts of subsidy policies necessarily pass a cost-benefit analysis. And the ""crony capitalism"" angle is a shrewd political strategy for them to attack the subsidies, because to some extent it crosses traditional partisan divides.

3. This is laughable. Musk is not a danger to Russia's interests in any meaningful way. There are not enough Teslas on the road, nor will there be for many years, to have an appreciable effect on Russia's oil exports. Besides, many other car companies are now producing EVs, so even if Musk was important in starting this trend, it's too late to reverse it by smearing Tesla specifically. Or is Russia also secretly funding anti-Chevy Volt fake news sites? As for the space industry, it's true that the use of RD-180s in Atlas V launch vehicles gives Russia a bit of soft power and a bit of money, so perhaps Russia has been harmed on the margins by the emergence of more competition in the US launch market. But again, if this were really enough to motivate a Russian state-sponsored propaganda response (which I highly doubt) wouldn't it also be targeted at other market participants like Arianespace?

4. Say what you will about libertarianism, as a movement, it's anything but anti-intellectual, and it's definitely not pro-fascist. The venues Bloomberg cites where the supposed ""fake news"" targeting Musk appeared include a lot of libertarian-themed sites.

5. Judging by the fancy cars I see in Hong Kong, Tesla's endangering the bottom lines of Mercedes and Lamborghini more than any oil and gas companies. Until it achieves profitability, Solar City is unlikely to endanger anyone's bottom line. And SpaceX is more harmful to ULA than to any Russian aerospace companies. So I guess we should conclude that Daimler AG and Boeing are the true devils funding this vile propaganda campaign?

Or maybe the whole thing is a ridiculous farce that no one should really get worked up about.

It's very apparent that the author of the referenced article from ""The Daily Signal"" doesn't like when the government subsidizes projects.  He assumes the ""green"" movement is a scam that Musk is taking advantage of, but has no information to back that up, other than lengthy R&D, and a lack of stellar profits. Cites that Musk has bought up a solar company that has gone under, and we are funding him in such endeavors, but has no proof about how that correlates with any sort of ""scam""

On top of having a fake author for three articles, two of which have been retracted, the whole thing is backed by a committee that is very much against Musk.  Does that not smell of an attempt to smear the man, instead of bring some sort of significant facts to light about him?

EDIT: There are 100,000 gallons of water in this lake.  Two years ago chickens drank 5,000 gallons from the lake. This past year they drank 8,000 gallons.  It's safe to say that chicken owners are abusing their right to have chickens drink water from the lake, all in an attempt to further profits in their chicken breeding businesses.  Why do we subsidize these breeders?  What if they fail?  <Insert some random facts about the value of chickens depreciating over the course of some odd years, and this is attempt by chicken owners to increase their profits.

3723,DukeDimmadome,http://qz.com/844425/fake-news-is-the-newest-strategy-for-taking-down-elon-musk-tesla-tsla-and-solarcity/,"I think the best way to deal with it demand-side. If you teach people at a young age to be skeptical (not paranoid or unreasonably untrusting, but skepticism in the way that scientists use it) it'll probably help weaken the power of fake news and propaganda in general, whether it's from the government or from the mainstream media or from cranks like Alex Jones. I honestly think that guys like Jones get away with what they do because too many people don't have a lot of practice with critical thinking and skepticism; they seem to think that skepticism means disbelieving everything from 'official channels' and believing everything from grainy Youtube videos and tacky-looking sites that they are linked to from Facebook. 

They don't really realize or acknowledge that everyone can lie and that just because someone poses as an underground figure doesn't mean that they can't lie or even be honestly mistaken themselves.

The toughest part though for is disbelieving something that matches our worldview. This is when it's actually more important to be skeptical; most people are pretty good at poking holes in stories that they already disagree with but not as good at even looking for the holes/inconsistencies/missing sources in stories that we agree with or that match what we already believe. Even outside of the context of politics and fake news, you see that problem in business and government too. The prosecutor who believes that the defendant is guilty and ignores or downplays the alibi witness... and the jailhouse snitch who seems to know only what was in the newspaper about the case... and the inconsistencies in the eyewitness accounts... and the 3 lab tests that were inconclusive... 

Or the executive who has been working on a merger for months and ignores the warning signs from the independent audit or the fact that the target company's main product is now outmoded and their sales are dropping like a stone.

Degrees don't equate to being smart in a LOT of cases.

The US isn't suffering from a brain drain problem in science, at least in a general sense when we say ""science."" soms individual disciplines are, but that's complex. The labor market is extremely oversaturated compared to funding levels, but funding is a problem more or less everywhere on the globe, despite what you think...and if funding isn't an issue there are other issues. Right now we have the opposite of brain drain going on.

You've described anecdotes and part-truths here. For instance, Canada's research funding sucks jist as much as ours. Grad school costs in Canada in most science disciplines is equal or eorse than ours. You make it sound like there is a rush or motivation in science to move to other developed countries

> The people who criticize Musk aren't just ""hateful types"" seeking a new target after the election, because the chronology doesn't bear that out. 

Can you expand on this? Multiple pieces started showing up after the election. So what part of the chronology doesn't work?

> This is overblown. There is a world of difference between ""the solar and electric vehicle industries have reaped the benefits from large amounts of government subsidies"" (which is true) and ""global warming is an evil hoax"". 

Yes, but we have a President-elect who believes the second and it doesn't take much scratching to find others who agree with him.

> This is laughable. Musk is not a danger to Russia's interests in any meaningful way. 

In the short-term, certainly not. In the long-term though? He's done more than any other individual to get the general public interested in solar power and electric cars. And 

> Or is Russia also secretly funding anti-Chevy Volt fake news sites?

If such sites started showing up, I wouldn't be at all surprised to find out if that they were funded in such a way.

> Say what you will about libertarianism, as a movement, it's anything but anti-intellectual, and it's definitely not pro-fascist. The venues Bloomberg cites where the supposed ""fake news"" targeting Musk appeared include a lot of libertarian-themed sites.

I agree that libertarians are not in general in that category. Which of the sites did you think had a libertarian lean? Also note that there's a fair bit of interplay between the conventional right, and the libertarian-right. And even for libertarians there's a definite anti-intellectual strain among some of them (the ones who are AGW skeptics are a pretty good example of this).

> Judging by the fancy cars I see in Hong Kong, Tesla's endangering the bottom lines of Mercedes and Lamborghini more than any oil and gas companies. Until it achieves profitability, Solar City is unlikely to endanger anyone's bottom line. And SpaceX is more harmful to ULA than to any Russian aerospace companies. So I guess we should conclude that Daimler AG and Boeing are the true devils funding this vile propaganda campaign?

Right now, I expect that Daimler and Boeing will in general behave better than the oil companies, simply based on the history of what the companies have done. But I do agree that 5 and 4 are somewhat unlikely: please note that I did list the various possible explanations in descending order of likelihood. 

> Or maybe the whole thing is a ridiculous farce that no one should really get worked up about.

These are just a few of the top threads on Paypal in entrepreneur.

Part of it is people not understanding the limits of Paypal, but many business owners feel they're treated unfairly in disputes. And feel trapped into using them by customers who will only pay that way. I've never had a large amount of money withheld, but I've had to call customer service about some small issues. It was shitty enough that I know it would be a nightmare if I had a more serious problem.

I doubt this has much to do with the right-wing shenanigans being discussed though. As other commenters have mentioned, looks like it's probably about the oil industry and Russia.",politics,t2_joyxa,5f4u7z,dahq13u,/r/politics/comments/5f4u7z/with_hillary_clinton_out_of_the_way_rightwing_and/dahq13u/,/r/politics/comments/5f4u7z/with_hillary_clinton_out_of_the_way_rightwing_and/

I think it no longer matters because e-commerce is such a huge part of our economy now, but 15 years ago it was definitely a huge issue. Things like eBay, amazon, paypal etc. were extremely hated by conservatives and threatened the way businesses traditionally worked. The internet really removed a lot of steps when it came to buying something and probably has resulted in the slow gutting of many jobs. Fortunately it created a lot of news ones, but the people who were stocking shelves at a wholesale warehouse probably aren't going to be the same people programming for paypal, you know?

As a rule of thumb, such ideas will almost always fail.

Inherently trying to inculcate a set of ideas into young students is impossible for *many* Many reasons, eg

1) Variance in simple education outcomes: Not all students are even at the same education level in the same grade. This means only some % of students will actually get the message

2) Students have been targetted to learn MANY things, and work loads for kids are going up. This only ads something more to their workload - which they will eventually ignore

3) Educated, sceptical people are the ones currently spreading mis information, if not creating it. The issue is also information that leverages modern psych/communication techniques to find ways to slip past the critical assessment.

So what lies do you believe? Do you believe the lie that if we all work together, everything will be OK? Or do you believe the lie that everything bad is the fault of people not like you?

I spent Thanksgiving with my sister and her husband, and I think they provide a good example why this is so. My sister outright said that socially she is a democrat, but economically she is a republican (i.e. She generally votes republican, though this year she voted for Gary Johnson). In her view, democrat = higher taxes which she is dead set against because it effects her bottom line.

The verbiage here makes it seem like the author is presenting facts, but it's the author's own personal observation to form an *opinion*.

Everything is all flames and metal and Elon comes out in a flamboyant steampunky power armor suit. Elon Musk makes a very short put impactful speech. He has decided humans are too foolish to govern themselves, and therefore he will take over and rule the world.

All the Teslas and Rockets Elon made over the years activate and join. The AI cyborgs starts dominating all cities and then countries one by one. Resistance is futile.

Hell, how do you *teach* science at all without teaching skepticism? I'm not suggesting that a set of ideas be ""inculcated"", it's more about giving people tools so that they can protect themselves. I think honestly if people looked at everything the way we teach kids to look at literature or art that would be a huge step forward. ""What message is this story trying to communicate?"" ""Why do you think this writer chose this language, or this symbolism?"" ""What information could this narrative be missing?""

You need these skills in business. You need them in politics. You need them as a babysitter or a nanny. You need them as a doctor.

play this song https://youtu.be/u4_ZRsHwrpw?t=50s

6 years later, society is actually better off in many ways in regards to health and crime, however the world is still very Orwellian authoritarian. Those guilty of thought crimes become guinea pigs and sent to live in experimental Space Colony slums. 

Elon receives reports of large numbers of robots being destroyed and some areas are being liberated. Elon brands this as a terrorist and wants them dead or alive. Whatever is destroying these robots are ruthless and effective. Whomever lays eyes on it never live to talk about it. 

2 years earlier, 5 college students, unaware of each other, from 5 different colleges,(Stanford, UC Berkeley, MIT, Cal Tech, and Carnegie Mellon) worked with their engineering schools to develop mobile power armor suits. After 4 years of development, the students graduate and deploy. 

They fly to different parts of the world, starting in small cities, destroying smaller robots, finding weaknesses in their AI, and gaining exp. They run into each other at random times, at first bumping heads for getting in each others ways or thinking another works for Elon. But they realize they're all on the same side and team up. 

Along the way they confront Elon's most powerful and ruthless generals including Steve Balmer and Larry Ellison.

play this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jVcn6I452I

After defeating all the generals, they decide they have leveled up with enough exp and finally make it to Elon Musk's castle. 

At the very top floor they find Elon Musk in his R&D Lab in his most powerful suit. They have a fierce showdown, that eventually ends up in the sky. And then, in space. He is significantly more powerful than any of the suits but the 5 of them working together damage Elon enough to beat him. 

After Elon is defeated, he wakes up! Turns out Elon Musk was being controlled by a Sorcerer from the future using gravity waves.

They realize the sorcerer then takes control of Sergey Brin and Larry Page to continue his plans. 

Elon Musk joins the team. They realize if they beat Sergey and Larry, the sorcerer will just control another person. The team decide to use gravity waves to go to the future to confront this sorcerer once and for all. Elon enlists the help of his top scientist, Emmett Lathrop ""Doc"" Brown, to build a time machine. 

The future is post apocalyptic. 

Turns out the sorcerer is Steve Jobs! 

He didn't die, he just went to the future to see how it turned out! He saw the horrors starting from 2016 that eventually led to the destruction of the worlds societies. Jobs concluded that humanity is inherently self destructive, and the only way to save it is to rule it, and then he used his Apple technologies to hack Elon Musks mind. 

The heroes try to fight him but Steve is too powerful. They manage to escape. 

They figure out the only one who can defeat Steve Jobs is the person who defeated him before: Bill Gates. 

They travel back to the present and recruit Bill Gates to join the party. 

They then travel Back To The Future and Bill Gates tries to defeat him, but Steve Jobs has gotten too powerful from training in the hypersonic time chamber, and Bill Gates has become too weak from running a charity instead of a ruthless business. 'This isn't the 90s anymore Bill'. 

But Bill Gates is like Batman, he always thinks ahead. He reveals he brought Steve Woz, and he knows of all of Steve Jobs weaknesses. Steve Jobs tries to re-recruit him but Steve Woz is too smart this time. 

Under Steve Woz's guidance the team is winning but in a last ditch effort Steve Jobs starts to compress all time and space into a singularity. Then this music starts playing. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LbnMiO59cY

The 8 Heroes travel the void and eventually find each other. They find Steve Jobs again.

There's a reason why Steve Jobs did this. In the singularity, he was able to find the mind-controlled Sergey Brin and Larry Page and fuse with them. 

And from the forbidden merger of Google and Apple, out emerges a new horrific God like creature. 

This song starts playing

https://youtu.be/lpvUEsLMsRc?t=1m35s

Now our heroes aren't just battling for their present time or future, they're fighting to save all time and space! 

They put a valiant effort and they fought until they had nothing left. But it was enough to weaken the creature, which then splits into Steve, Sergey, and Larry. They walk over to Steve unconscious body, but he then wakes up!

He immediately severely damages one of the power suits. Steve is still able to fight though severely weakened! But at that point the team is so weak, they no longer can fight. It looks hopeless. 

Then out of the singularity, Steve Jobs biological dad appears! This song starts playing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIo7yajLQtY

He reflects on Job's adoptions and talks how even though humanity makes mistakes, it means well, and that it doesn't need saving from itself, but needs saving from a few individuals bent on controlling it, even for altruistic purposes. 

He then tells Steve Jobs to look into the future how the world would turn out under his rule. Steve does, and discovered it is suffering a similar apocalyptic fate, even under his rule. With tears in his eyes, Steve now realizes the truth. 

Steve has to release the singularity, but in order to do so he must sacrifice himself. Before he does so, he talks to Elon. Then he heads into the void, releasing all time and space from the singularity. He sends all of them to the time right before Elon Makes the announcement, but only Elon has memories of the events. The whole taking over the world never happened, and Gates, Woz, and the 5 students never end up being freedom fighters, and have no recollection of the events that transpired. Everything seems peaceful but from Steve's words Elon knows if things continue the way they are, the peace won't last. But that humanity doesn't need saving from itself, but needs saving from a few individuals bent on controlling it, even for altruistic purposes. 

Elon knows exactly what he needs to do.

Elon finds Thrillary (Trump fused with Hillary) and does this to it

https://youtu.be/q4CNM89W9k0?t=49s

Elon looks towards the sunrise. He knows that the future isn't secure, but he's very optimistic. 

Elon knows that he is the only one in the world who can recall how he saved the world. But it doesn't matter, he has to get to work and focus on his new mission, getting humanity to outer space when the earth inevitability becomes inhabitable. 

The End. . .Or is it. . .

But, Elon wasn't the only one who knew about the events that transpired in this passage. In an office on the other side of Silicon Valley, Mark Zuckerburg watches the whole thing on an Occulus Rift designed to view alternative realities. He feels that Steve Jobs had the right idea, but was too self delusional to properly control the world. He knew that it needs to be done through temptation, not force, and that's why Steve Job's society resulted in another dystopia. 

Mark starts laying out his plans. Not Elon, Woz, nor Gates will be able to stop him.

His big concern is that shows like X-Files make scientific claims that not everyone will have the critical thinking skills to separate the fact from fiction (aliens or not).

Now:  one problem is that TSLA has continually been misleading about a lot of its numbers.  That doesn't mean TSLA will fail, but it's always a reason to increase scrutiny.

Now, the specific reason I am doubtful is that the worshipful narrative is that Musk is a genius who sees this obvious opportunity while the rest of the car companies are idiots.

What I think is the case is that the current tech is just not there yet for a profitable electric car that sells to the mass market.

We will get there at some point,but when we do TSLA will face immediate competition for the majors who will have a large cost advantage.

Under this scenario, the battery factory is not a plus for TSLA but is actually a negative because it has them committed to a tech/process and the resultant overhead before the business model is really figured out.

Now ultimately we can talk about this until we are all blue in the face, and really we won't know until we find it if TSLA can really produce and sell the model 3 for less than 40k.

However, it's usually difficult to discuss this because ""Elon"" has a large group of fan boys who aren't interested in anything but promoting the company line.  That in and of itself is usually a warning sign.

Often it's something that someone wrote as a joke that got taken out of context (such as an Onion article, or an out of date urban legend that someone mistook for something recent. There isn't a complex web of lies to sift through or an elaborate smokescreen of fake evidence, just a single story that someone shares without thinking that develops a life of its own.

And even if someone doesn't do that much, if they get to the point where they feel mild suspicion when they see an article from a source they've never heard of claiming that China is selling plastic rice to Americans, that's actually pretty useful.

Likewise, it is likely that the Russian government may have had some hand in releasing secret DNC emails to WikiLeaks. The media and the Clinton campaign then implied that this must mean Trump is a ""Russian pawn"". Again, there is no logical connection, and the implication was made to scare voters.

I think that this is pretty much the basis for TSLA – they're paving the road themselves to drive down costs by working out better designs, better batteries, better manufacturing, and in the process they're building a strong brand. Like it or not, owning a Tesla is a status symbol in a lot of circles. It may not be the wisest economical decision, but for people who value green tech, owning a Tesla is like putting solar panels on your roof or buying organic.

Not to mention, they're effectively first to market, which is usually a pretty sweet position to be in.

I'm not saying it'll work, but I think it will. As much as the major auto manufacturers have an advantage in terms of capital and infrastructure, Tesla is building a desirable brand.

Apparently not many self-proclaimed American patriots said that Trump's America First foreign policy is not only a disaster, but incredibly racist.  Nearly a third of the American electorate disagrees with putting America first.

>  but public goods need to be government funded or else they wouldn't be provided at all.

Have you ever heard of government corporations?  They do not need to contract private businesses at all.  That's interfering in our market and decreasing competition. 

>  but it's not like the government can stop spending on military altogether

The fix is really easy and if I remember Obama said he would do it.  No more no-bid contracts.  

>  Should the government give up on NASA as well?

Considering the importance of NASA when it was installed and the relative unimportance of it now maybe.  

>  I mean if the US government offers clean energy incentives, he should take them.

Why?  Do you realize that subsidizing clean energy incentives either 

1.) Hurts competing businesses within the industry causing slower growth. 

2.) Hurts our economy causing slower growth.  

It is not the way to achieve clean energy it's the opposite.  Elon Musk has his money and will get his money no matter what he actually accomplishes.  That's the problem of crony capitalism.  

By the way you forfeited your right to criticize capitalism when you willingly embrace crony capitalism.  The faults of capitalism are because of crony capitalism not because of the free-market which worked for thousands of years (mercantilism before capitalism).

>  It's up to the government to decide how the money is spent, not Musk. 

Just like how it's up to the government to decide not the lobbyists which fund them.  He's part of the problem.  

>  If the government offers small business subsidies should they reject them?

That never happens and if it were it would depend on what is being subsidized or what's the attempt.

Government corporations are often inefficient at achieving the same results. I think there are pros and cons to each approach (I dislike some of the cons to privatizing government sectors).

I agree that no-bid contracts are in most cases bullshit.

In what way was NASA important when it was installed and is no longer?

I would argue that either subsidies or carbon tax is necessary because neither customers nor the producers ""price in"" the cost of pollution. Its an externality, in other words. The goal of the subsidies/taxes is to hurt the businesses that cause the externalities, effectively internalizing them. Yes, this will hurt the economy in the short term to benefit it in the long term.

Free market only works to an extent. It does not answer a lot of social and economic problems.

Lobbyists are not problematic until they start bribing politicians. If you reduce lobbying to its core, its just people telling the government the position of their industry on an issue. Once lobbyists start having dinner with the politicians or exchanging favors though... I agree with you that the current state of lobbying is problematic.

Truth be told, SpaceX relies on the government for contracts.  Yes, Musk's mission for SpaceX is to ultimately send humans on a mission to Mars.  But in the meantime, stuff like government contracts for SpaceX help pay the bill while SpaceX is still developing the technology and plan for a mission to Mars.

Musk is the polar opposite of Trump - Musk sees clean energy as the future.  Musk took a hit to his reputation by joining the advisory board so SpaceX wouldn't suffer for it (he also lost some Tesla sales because of it).  For Musk to leave the advisory board, it may lead to Trump cutting contracts with SpaceX and/or hampering SpaceX.  Musk is not doing this lightly and he is risking the future of SpaceX because he thinks Trump has gone too far.

A lot of people called for him not to be on this council because it sent the wrong message and was clearly a move by Elon to get closer to the government he probably needs to help him move further along without running into regulatory issues. Typical businesses getting unfair treatment us plebs can't enjoy. Probably good PR for Trump as well. It was a smart move for Elon, relatively.

Of course Reddit was cool with this. Claimed he'd be in a better position to force Trump's hand on important matters -- we'll see how this goes down. Even after numerous photos of Elon Musk schmoozing with Steve Bannon and Trump, the circlejerk believed the billionaire is gonna save the world during this administration. Right.

In reality, Elon is working with the military industrial complex to score well-paying contracts firing missiles while wooing Reddit with dumb lip-service to way off ideas like AI running rampant and humans living cushy on mars. In the meantime his factories are running the engineers and workers dry, demanding every morsel of their being in return for Elon's ego stroking returns.

But for us, this is exactly why it is a good thing Musk got in:

Even if Trump wont personally listen, Musk withdrawing would probably have a big impact on the public perception of the advisory board and more members will have to make a choice to stay or leave.

All the nations of the world send their best runner to a marathon. In order to combat climate change, the runners pledge to cut their breathing since c02 is a product of energy production.

Some countries are new and inexperienced, and pledge to try to cut their breathing.

Some countries are dishonest, and wont cut their breathing at all.

The USA pledges to cut its breathing by 25+% and will honor it.

Europe also pledges to cut its breathing by 25+% and will honor it.

China, who breathes the most, smirks and says I too will cut my breathing the best I can.

Elon's opinion of it should be taken with a dump truck of salt since his business ventures are set to benefit greatly if the US is under a potential Paris Agreement.  
  
I like Elon, I like when people take care of Earth, but his opinion of this is super bias and the Paris Agreement isn't really going to fix the real problems we're facing.  
  
They're trying to regulate beef production. I know cows create lots of co2, but really?

Their involvement is used  for political purposes by Trump, but the hope is that he--or more likely, his staffers--will at least hear what they have to say at least sometimes.

Is that likely? Apparently not, given his behavior to date and the sort of staffers he has surrounded himself with. But as long as these advisors can at least hope they'll make a small, tiny little difference, it's tough as hell for them to accept defeat. Hope can be a wonderful thing, but it can also keep you from realizing when a situation is beyond saving.
