The difference is that a person cannot actually \*literally\* be an anus, (figuratively, sure, but not literally).  Therefore he can't argue that he can get a job now because people think he's a 6 foot sphincter.

&#x200B;

Calling someone a pedophile CAN be literally true, and will change how people look at him, and will affect his ability to get/keep a job etc.  True damage can be done.

Same with ""knobhead"".  Nobody will believe he literally has a penis on his forehead, so it won't affect his career or professional life.

The fact that you just referred to him as a pedophile contradicts your statement.

512,EmploymentLawHelper,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48238576?intlink_from_url=&link_location=live-reporting-story,"Well first of all, calling someone a pedophile is an accusation that constitutes slander/libel per se, while the same is not true of saying that something was a publicity stunt.

Second, “opinion” has a sort of slippery definition in defamation law.  Think about it, anyone could just claim “hey that’s like my opinion man” about any given statement.  What the courts usually look at is whether a reasonable listener could understand the statement as asserting a statement of verifiable fact, i.e. something that is provably false.  Accusations of pedophilia fall exactly into that category (which is part of the reason that they constitute per se defamation).  On the other hand, you can’t really *prove* that Elon’s actions were or were not a publicity stunt.  That means the latter is most likely legally an opinion, while the former is not.

Finally, Elon is a public figure for purposes of defamation law in this case, by virtue of his celebrity and by his voluntary involvement in this story.  That means there’s a higher standard for finding that accusations against him were defamatory.  Elon would have to prove that the diver KNEW his accusations were false or that the diver showed a reckless disregard for their truth/falsity.

On the other hand, it is much less likely that the diver would be held to be even a limited-purpose public figure.  Private figures need only prove that the slanderous person (Elon) was negligent in making the allegedly defamatory accusation.",news,t2_1upquyef,bnfkry,en5t6sl,/r/news/comments/bnfkry/elon_musk_must_defend_himself_in_court_after/en5t6sl/,/r/news/comments/bnfkry/elon_musk_must_defend_himself_in_court_after/

Currently the best model is essentially a maglev train. If this continues to be the case hyperloop will never be a viable thing, since a normal maglev is going to be more cost effective and far safer as the hyperloop would require a pressurized cabin inside a depressurized hyperloop track. Which also means that after and before debarkation the space around the cabin would need to be pressurized and depressurized. IIRC they estimated a 30 minute cycle to do that, meaning that the hyperloop would need to be at least 1 hour faster than a traditional high-speed train to provide any time saving.

Hyperloop cabins are also inherently more limited in their turning radius than standard train cars, which may limit their effectiveness in navigating inner city areas.

In this case, the special treatment is not coming from somewhere you can ""take away"". People like to follow celebrities, go figure.

The only special treatment here is that, because someone is rich people care more about them being punished for stuff they'd totally ignore otherwise or heck shouldn't even be punished (in my opinion).

Another legal issue though not directly relevant but related due to international legality is Apple and it's tax haven in Ireland, through loop holes Apple has avoided paying taxes by having billions processed at a nonexistent HQ in Ireland that only exist for a brief period and is dismissed once said money is processed.  International courts only now realized that Apple has been taking advantage of how far behind several laws are to just not pay taxes.

If your point is that we have the same level of evidence for the pedo accusation as the accusation levied against Musk, you may be right, however, the evidence required of accusing someone of being a bit of a dick is a lot fucking less than the evidence required to accuse someone of one of the most heinous and vile crimes a human can commit. I think most people would agree on that. 

And of course Musk did it because of his ego. It isn't like your brain decides to do things based on one reason; there are many factors involved and the factor you choose as your reasoning is rarely even the most influential one and never the only one. Musk probably even believes ego had nothing to do with it, but anyone who has watched his Twitter can probably agree he is at least a bit of an egoist.

The hyperloop is fucking gonzo even if you did have the magical engineering required to build the infrastructure cheaply and efficiently. There's a civil engineer on YouTube called donoteat that has a video just going into some of the relatively basic stuff that's wrong with it.

Electric cars are a distraction. More public transportation and infrastructure innovation is what we need. We can't keep having it so that everybody needs a car to function in american society. Not only are wages going to go down but cost of goods, particularly food, is going to rise. The impact of creating and replacing gas vehicles is not nearly enough to help curtail the damage of climate change.

Fuck SpaceX. Look, I want to go to space like everybody else but if we're gonna go to Mars, which is at least decades off just expeditionary travel even in ideal conditions, we need to make sure that there's an Earth to come back to. It's another distraction at best. At worst it's a chance for the oil barons who ruined the planet to escape the doomsday that they caused and let them set up fiefdoms on another planet because you know the rich are going to have the power.

Tesla could be doing some real good and sometimes it does. Their home batteries aren't as amazing as some think but they're a step in the right direction and not a distraction. I wish instead of wasting time trying to get people to buy cars that sometimes explode for no reason and will traffic disasters if implemented full scale they'd focus on innovating buses. Instead of the loop they could just work on innovative improvements to subways and monorails instead of trying to convince people to take their randomly combusting Tesla cars into a tiny tunnel that really wouldn't function any differently than a freeway, except be much more expensive with much deadlier accidents.",news,t2_1upquyef,bnfkry,en88qf5,/r/news/comments/bnfkry/elon_musk_must_defend_himself_in_court_after/en88qf5/,/r/news/comments/bnfkry/elon_musk_must_defend_himself_in_court_after/

I am not so sure. This article mentions a law enacted by Richard II that talks about ""devisers of false news and of horrible and false lies"".  Richard II was king from 1377 to 1399.  Wouldn't this have to been concerned with things spread in ""public forums"", i.e. word of mouth?? Is word of mouth really fundamentally different than forwarding an email, or cut/pasting from one social media site to another,  or re-tweeting something?

It's a tort not a crime. For defamation law the tort takes place anywhere the defamatory statement is published.

So, for example, the New York Times can be sued for libel about anywhere in the US because the paper is distributed across the country. It does not matter where the hypothetical interview took place or was actually printed.

Unless the plaintiff is a public figure intent is not an element in a defamation case.

The defendant has the burden of proof as to truth since it's an affirmative defense. Musk only wins if he proves that the plaintiff is a pedophile.

The internet has been around and heavily used for more than 20 years. The law has largely caught up with most of the issues it presents - the tougher one is actually jurisdictional issues and minimum contacts - since the internet has no boundaries and is not tied to any specific geographical boundaries.

The law as it relates to opinions and insults in other media (TV, radio, newspapers and the like) will be applied here. There's nothing difficult about this case at all.

Electric cars are a step in the right direction. They are way better than everyone using gas powered cars. 

The hyperloop does have some problems but its a better idea than everyone else just sitting on there ass and not doing anything about the problem. 

I mean SpaceX even tho it has goals to go to mars the real big thing was making the privatized space industry possible and practical. The government keeps defunding nasa and space travel is one of the best ways to figure out new ways to do different things that can benefit us on earth. Look at all the inventions that came out of the space race.

I think you dont understand how enginneering works at all. There is no quick or easy solution that is 100% viable and will work for everyone. Taking baby steps and trying different things is how we learn. Im not saying all these things are the best solution but they are better steps than most people doing nothing.

And that, at least here in my country, if you sue me because i called you a pedophile on twitter over the terms of defamation good luck with that. Unless you can pull off some amazing favors that'll not be accepted to even go into a trial.

Defamation is something serious and not every way of public insult is one. Let's not mix and match things as we see fit to help our own agenda.

The fact that you are going this far to defend your position in this case is proof enough that, people want to see the rich suffer in ways they'd not think is fit for others. You didn't say if i tweet about my neighbor no, your example is something much more planned vs out of anger momentary tweets to try to put them in same basket.

One is that for most part they’re relying on technology invented and perfected by others, which in itself is nothing wrong but it does get annoying when they intentionally mislead people to think they’re some kind of innovative pioneering company. The other is that their cars are simply... poorly made. Friends Model S spent more time being fixed than actually driving (which is also thanks to Tesla customer service), and when it was driving it was really “meh” especially given price tag. Model 3 I drove on the other hand was just poorly made by any standards. Noisy and squeaking, with surprisingly poor materials period (I’ve compared it to Dacia more than once...), not even getting to price tag (although that’s true for most American cars), and very weird drive quality: uncomfortable and unstable at the same time. And again range is impressive but that’s pretty understandable given how much batteries they crammed into the car that’s too big anyways.

Space X on the other hand did some really nice job getting down price tag for LEO launches. They made real advances in flight controls and kudos to them for that. But they’re still vastly overhyped in many ways. They’re still just that: LEO launching cheap alternative. Falcon Heavy doesn’t really have mind blowing capabilities (especially if you want stage recovery which is the main selling point here), and same goes for Dragon. What SpaceX did is use a lot of know how from variety of previous American projects, and developed into something nice using even more NASA money. Don’t get me wrong: it’s nice they got where they are now but ideas they’re working with aren’t exactly revolutionary. What they are is simply attempt to drive cost downs for American space programme’s “mundane” needs of LEO launches via COTS initiative. They’re easily the best in that bunch but that’s basically it, there’s not much more to all that. What they are absolutely not is vanguard of space flight (unless you equate that to cost effective ways of getting “stuff” to LEO) or whatever the hell you think of: that’s very much a facade.

For one thing, there's no real reason to bring up the ""rampant underaged sex trafficking"", whether or not it's true, unless it's to make a dig at either Thailand or the diver who chooses to live there.

877,IllCaesar,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48238576?intlink_from_url=&link_location=live-reporting-story,"> How are self driving cars a disaster waiting to happen. It can't possibly be worse than the amount of accidents we have right now.

Yes actually, they can. They only really work in a closed system where all of the vehicles abide by the same stringent set of rules with no outside presence or in very, very simply transportation systems, namely highways. For self-driving cars to work every single car has to be properly maintained to not experience a performance altering malfunction (not gonna happen), every car has to be driven by an intelligence (not gonna happen), every intelligence must abide by the same priorities (not gonna happen), every driver has to follow by the rules at all times and not override the intelligence (not gonna happen), pedestrians have to follow by the same rules (not gonna happen), pedestrians have to not make mistakes or fall in the middle of the street or fall off crossing platforms or run into the street to rescue a stray animal (not gonna happen), and animals have to stay off the road (not gonna happen). There's more to it than that too. Autonomous transportation isn't a bad idea in relatively simple systems where there is little that can no wrong and none of it can be from external factors. It works fairly well in warehouses and some systems that operate on tracks like trains or monorails. Cars though? Complete fantasy. Wouldn't even be practical even if we could improve the self-driving programs to a point of competence, which they're currently not either. If one wrench gets thrown into that equation everthing is going to fall apart.

> Electric cars are a step in the right direction. They are way better than everyone using gas powered cars.

Electric cars are too little too late. There's too many cars on the road anwas and that causes many other infrastructural issues, particularly in densely populated areas. We need to be transitioning our public transportation to cause lower impact *and* reduce the amount of vehicles on the road. We don't need to eliminate cars but we do need to reduce their usage. If we eliminated cars and supported public transportation then besides reducing environmental impact people would have less need for cars since we wouldn't need enormous and grossly wasteful parking lots taking up space where businesses, homes, and bus stops could be. Some people will always need cars, no doubt, especially many people with disabilities or other significant impairments, but we need to be reducing our use of cars. The sooner we start the soon we can adjust the infrastructure which would then lead to even less usage.

> The hyperloop does have some problems but its a better idea than everyone else just sitting on there ass and not doing anything about the problem.

[Please set aside some time later and watch this.](https://youtu.be/4dn6ZVpJLxs) He's an actual civil engineer and on top of that the dude's funny and genuinely entertaining. He's got a lot of really interesting and thoughtful content on the rest of his channel too. But if you need a ten second summary, screw the loop, just build subways based on other subways that already exist.

> I mean SpaceX even tho it has goals to go to mars the real big thing was making the privatized space industry possible and practical. The government keeps defunding nasa and space travel is one of the best ways to figure out new ways to do different things that can benefit us on earth. Look at all the inventions that came out of the space race.

Privitization of space faring is at best a venture to waste rich people's money. Privitization cuts corners and mostly siphons from the inventions of the public sector or publically funded businesses. The space race was't won via capitalism and it wasn't lost via communism, it was won as a well supplied cooperative scientific venture in the U.S. and it was lost as a divisive, corrupt race to the top of various factions vying for prestiege in the USSR. The goal of private business is to make money, not further the public good. Look at insulin - the patent was sold for one dollar because its creator wanted anybody who needed it to have it. Today in the U.S. it on average costs three dollars to produce one month's worth and costs four hundred and fifty dollars to get a month's supply.

> I think you dont understand how enginneering works at all. There is no quick or easy solution that is 100% viable and will work for everyone.

No, there's not. The fantasies of an out of touch trust fund kid who pals around with actual vampire Peter Thiel and calls people a pedophile when he gets butthurt over them saying his ideas are bad are not the answer though. They're not even close. Tesla is developing some actual useful and important technology but that's the small potatoes stuff that's mostly relegated to the background. Musk could be doing far more but he chooses not to.

> America isn't ready for a big public transportation overhaul because we have no one to lead it

Yes, we do, and in fact we could easily have more. Elon Musk could be one of them if he wanted to. He chooses not to. He chooses to use his public profile to support flashy vanity projects rather than put forward actual solutions.

It's sort of like that one episode of the Simpsons where they waste all of their money on a monorail. Elon Musk wants to be and thinks he's Lisa Simpson but really he's more like the monorail salesman. Except in this situation the monorail salesman isn't a crook, he's just earnest in his foolish endeavor.

Who isn't? All of these companies today are standing upon the shoulders of giants (even if those giants were engineers that worked in those companies a hundred years ago); what they're doing is taking those 'perfected' technologies and improving them further and adapting them to their applications.

Tesla works with Panasonic to develop better Li-Ion cells for cars, they build their own battery packs using industry-leading thermal management techniques, they use motors that are some of, if not the best in the industry, they have integrated power management boards that are more compact than anyone else's, they now have the world's most capable neural net processor for a car, etc.

>it does get annoying when they intentionally mislead people to think they’re some kind of innovative pioneering company.

Can you give some examples of this?

> The other is that their cars are simply... poorly made.

A fair and common criticism; they'll eventually get better at manufacturing and catering to car enthusiasts.

>very weird drive quality: uncomfortable and unstable at the same time.

I'm familiar with people saying that Teslas are weird to drive, but not uncomfortable and I've never once heard someone (even here on Reddit, prior to you) describe them as unstable.

>into the car that’s too big anyways.

If you're talking about the Model 3 that's also a criticism I've never once heard about prior. The Model S on the other hand is a bit big though apparently.

>But they’re still vastly overhyped in many ways. They’re still just that: LEO launching cheap alternative.

SpaceX also launches things to MEO, GEO, etc for cheap.

>Falcon Heavy doesn’t really have mind blowing capabilities (especially if you want stage recovery which is the main selling point here)

If you're willing to expend it, the Falcon Heavy can lift more mass into space than any other rocket operational today. With recovery you get the rough equivalent of an Atlas V with 4x SRBs for significantly less money.

>same goes for Dragon

If SpaceX hadn't ditched Crew Dragon's propulsive landing plan it would've been mind-blowing from a re-usability standpoint, but today it isn't terribly special overall.

>What SpaceX did is use a lot of know how from variety of previous American projects, and developed into something nice using even more NASA money.

And a considerable amount of private investment / commercial revenue as well.

>What they are is simply attempt to drive cost downs for American space programme’s “mundane” needs of LEO launches via COTS initiative.

Nothing about Falcon 9 / Heavy is COTS.

>They’re easily the best in that bunch but that’s basically it, there’s not much more to all that.

You seem to be completely ignoring Starlink and Starship; the things they're spending nearly all their R&D on currently. I can understand if you're sceptical about Starship happening, but they are making good progress with the Raptor engine for it, their flight test program with Starhopper is progressing slowly but steadily (they just added RCS thrusters to it last week) and the switch to a steel design will make it significantly easier for SpaceX to fund its development and construction.

Model 3 is still large family car by standard of where I live, and it’s weirdly wide even compared to those. That might not be an issue for US but one of weird things we ran into was actually getting it into friends garage to charge: we had to fold the mirrors to get it through the door and opening doors inside was challenging.

As far as ride quality I found it harsh on uneven surface but fairly mushy and body-roll prone when cornering. Honestly what I think was the biggest issue though was weird intrusive traction control system basically making me feel like I’m vaguely shouting at a guy actually doing steering.  Part of it might be the fact it was winter and there was all kinds of potholes and ice all around, but than again I’ve never driven a car so weird and all over the place before or since in this kind of conditions (note: I only been passenger in Model S, but I did drive eGolf and Leaf in snow and they were fine so I don’t think it’s EV issue).

Regarding Falcon Heavy, yes it does fill a niche that nobody really does nowadays but the issue here is why. I mentioned Energia before, and it’s not like making a heavy lift rocket of comparable capabilities (excluding costs) is that hard. The issue is it’s in weird limbo of uselessness. For most use cases it’s more practical to either downsize payload, or use multiple launches, and for really heavy and large “stuff” there’s little commercial use.

Everything about Falcon 9/Heavy is COTS, as in it’s part of Commercial Orbital Transport Services. I get what you mean though, no it’s not cobbled together out of Ali Express parts.

Issues of Starlink are not in it happening or not but simple physics and how useful it will be. Obviously it depends how you look at it: it’s good project if you want to create wide network for those who otherwise would have no access whatsoever, or would depend on even worse geostationary systems, or on some absolutely abysmal terrestrial network. The issue of distances involved however combined with inherent latency introduced by each step of the process itself would still mean for most part the semi competent terrestrial system will likely be superior.

Funnily enough BFR/Starship overall ideas are something I’m not skeptical at all. It goes in right direction both in terms of volume and payload. What I don’t see is SpaceX coming even close to the timelines I’ve heard about, and realistically I see them getting it ready around the same time Long March 9 and whatever the hell Russians will settle on... meaning closer to 2030.",news,t2_1upquyef,bnfkry,en6ms6c,/r/news/comments/bnfkry/elon_musk_must_defend_himself_in_court_after/en6ms6c/,/r/news/comments/bnfkry/elon_musk_must_defend_himself_in_court_after/

946,Fresherty,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48238576?intlink_from_url=&link_location=live-reporting-story,"When it comes to Tesla vs “legacy manufacturers” there’s plenty of issues in what each company wants to achieve. I’d absolutely concede Tesla’s “electric” part is easily their most competitive aspect but the market itself is really weird now with variety of government programs pushing for EVs. The issue is they’re really far from having the “car” part ironed out... oh and I actually take offense to the whole “autopilot” debacle considering what it really is under the hood. Bottom line is now that markets are slowly moving towards EVs and “legacy manufacturers” start to actually take part I don’t think Tesla has much in it unless they actually get their shit together... because again there’s no special sauce there.

And again when it comes to SpaceX it’s not really that the launches are mundane. I absolutely agree the certain aspects of Falcon 9 are absolutely innovative and in many ways ground breaking, but we need to look at it for what it is: LEO delivery system. Not only that you also need to look into just how much US government invested in SpaceX, and look at how small the market really is, to realize just why there’s little competition here (basically only ULA and Blue Origins, both equally benefited from the same programs). What’s a bit unfair here is SpaceX PR takes a lot of limelight out of other space flight achievements out there. Difference here is SpaceX fills a niche of cost effective space flight while honestly for most part commercial activities are footnote in Chinese, Indian or even Russian space programs (at least in theory... Russia has been milking Soyuz so much recently I’m not sure anymore). The other thing is rockets aren’t as simple as payload to LEO with cost calculated in it. There are other considerations, and reasons why things like Energia are retired... and why - say - Chinese aim at something significantly more capable than Falcon Heavy (but than again Falcon Heavy will benefit heavily from US military expenditure). Finally as far as human space flight goes that’s yet another set of issues. Basically what I’m saying is the real challenges for SpaceX are in future not the past.",news,t2_1upquyef,bnfkry,en6gsap,/r/news/comments/bnfkry/elon_musk_must_defend_himself_in_court_after/en6gsap/,/r/news/comments/bnfkry/elon_musk_must_defend_himself_in_court_after/

I think he bought computers for kids who really needed them, got the shit end of a stick, and because he can. He tried to provide power to PR. He tries to make renewable energy cool. He does some crazy shit every once in while. Who gives a shit. I dunno I don't know the guy or if he has some asshole ulterior motives. All I know is that when he pops up in the news it's either he's doing something good for normal people, wasting money on something that's hilarious like a car with a crash test dummy in space, or he's being put on blast for something hilarious like ripping a joint on the radio.

No shit. Everyone needs clean water. But keep in mind, the places with the highest lead levels that were initially found were the damn schools. Those kids are going to have struggles. There is not much opportunity for academic supplementation in the Flint Community Schools. The teachers are overworked, more underpaid than most, and they try, but when there are very small number of social workers rotating through all the schools, and the teachers have 40+ kids to a class, you cannot assist every student that needs it. The parents have to help, and the students have to want it. How do you make kids want to learn in todays society? You hand them a device. And you give parents the resources to assist. Not all of them will take the bait, but even one is better than none. 

I am not mad that a private entity is not paying to replace the pipes. I am mad that a private entity has to offer, that the same government that allowed this to happen in the first place, can't be arsed to now go above and beyond to mitigate the effects of the problem they caused and then tried to cover up. It's just completely pathetic that the people that caused this can't/won't do a damn thing to help offer the assistance that is now needed. Because it goes beyond replacing pipes. It goes beyond expanding Medicaid. It goes beyond free preschool. It goes beyond water filters. It will ripple down through every family and every child that was exposed for many, many years. Even once that water is safe, the problem isn't solved. Frankly, it never can be. But it shouldn't be private individuals trying to solve it. It never should have happened and it should never be forgotten that there is always more that the city, county, state themselves could be doing.

He looks you directly in the eye. “But you've seen me everywhere, haven't you?” A film projects behind him. Images of rockets exploding, one 65 million dollar failure after another.

“I staked my career on colonizing mars. But now my shame will no longer define my legacy. This is the day a Muskrat will rise from the ashes, adorned in its Tesla flightsuit, and ascend to immortality.”

The film changes. Images of people, their eyes wide with fear or caution, like they've never seen a camera before.

“Uncontacted indigenous people.” He pours milk into his Cheerios. “The last human beings on Earth who've never had contact with the civilized world.” He’s still pouring the milk. “But what good are people who don't purchase goods and perpetuate the menstruation-like cycle of innovation?” The milk is overflowing from the mug, leaking off the table and into his lap. The heat radiating from his boardshorts evaporates the fluid into steam on contact.

“So I asked myself, what would our heavenly father do?” He removes his shirt to reveal an elaborate crucifixion tattoo across his veiny, throbbing pectorals, his sandy brown chest hair growing around it in patches. His left nipple replaces the head of Longinus, his right the head of Mary Magdalene.

“And do you know what he told me?” He grabs you by the hand. “Do you know the universal secret?” He briefly fondles your breasts, but you push him away, flirtatiously mouthing no, no, no. You know you want him. But you don't remember how you got here. You don't remember your name. You remember nothing but Elon.

The film changes. Images of an enormous armored vessel. Militaristic on the outside, the interior exudes elegance; full bar, kitchen, gaming tables, and a huge, impenetrable observation window.

“Our Father, through his only-begotten son, came before me in a dream. The Almighty and the Christ sat side-by-side in the holiest of holies, the inner sanctum, not of heaven, but of meaning itself. And behold, I saw the Mammon. Truly I say to you, the three were not in bitter dispute, but united together, each an introgial piece of the Holy Trinity, the base-most expression of God.”

“And what did God say to you, big boy?” You say, playing footsie with his milk-soaked black business socks.

“Ignorant harlot!” He screams, throwing the mug of Cheerios and milk in your face. “Do you desire my milk so badly, you can not discern for yourself God’s message from this vision?” You shake your head no, ashamed you've displeased your master.

He rubs your head, massaging the milk on his hands deep into your scalp. “Child, do you wish to possess this esoteric knowledge?”

“Yes, Papi Musk”, you say. Your conscious mind awakens as you realize you have no control of your actions, words, or emotions. “Your lessons begin now”, he says, loosening the drawstring on his shorts.

You pull his shorts off and see a large pink udder with four teets stuffed into his Teen Titans Go! boxer-briefs. You lovingly guide a teet through the folds. It's already dripping with pre-milk. “Suck it”, he says, grabbing your hair and pulling you closer. You obey your master and begin suckling. His warm milk squirts down your throat.

“Everybody has a place in the system”, he says. “as ordained by God’s laws of nature. Even when they seem lost and useless, He appoints a prophet to help them—to do His will.” His milk is getting warmer and more viscous.

“Truly I say to you, that prophet will channel the Mammon, and through him all people will find their purpose.” His piping hot milk globs down your throat and scalds your esophagus, but you can't let go of the teet.

“The Tesla Amphibious Observation Vessel. Now the world’s leaders and innovators have a window into the lives of primitive man, commodifying their existence and finally giving them purpose.”

The film changes. Images of the vessel in New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit—crushing cars, busses, and people while Elon, Jeff Bezos, Charles Koch, Oprah Winfrey, and Kanye West peer out the observation window.

“Everyone has a place in the system” he says.
“And you? You're my little milk slave.”",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec7sbwb,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec7sbwb/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

but people (especially media) don't seem to care about negative test results when emotions get involved.  

like most of flint, lead levels are not an issue in the schools (or prison) with their properly maintained water infrastructure. lead levels in homes were bad in slightly more than the threshold for EPA action but they're not that different from the national average. a large majority of people in flint would have been perfectly fine to drink the water even at the height of the attention.  


flint is a poor community with a lot of old run down houses that still have shoddy lead pipes much past their expected life because people can't afford to pay to replace them.  these are the houses that have high lead levels.  it's coming from pipes in the houses that are beyond the direct control of the city. 

don't get me wrong, the city definitely made the problem worse, but things weren't great for these people before ",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec7esun,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec7esun/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

Google is telling me Musk's net worth [is $23 Billion](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-elon-musk-net-worth-2017-10), and the median American net worth [is $45,000](https://money.cnn.com/2014/06/11/news/economy/middle-class-wealth/index.html). 

423k divided by 23 billion is 0.00001826086, or 0.001826086%, so he's donated about 0.002% of his total networth, in laptops. 

This proportion is the equivalent of someone with the Median American net worth donating $0.82, or someone with Average American net worth donating $5.50. 

I don't mind Elon Musk. I just want to make a counterpoint, that while this amount donated is substantial and impactful, calling it 'generous regardless' might not be completely fair.

lemme respond to your ""good"" musk items:

>*He's pushing the bounds of space exploration and electric cars.*

musk's only contribution to space exploration and electric cars is his investment in them -- his immense wealth is a direct result of the policies that rob the common man of income and starve the public sphere of funding in favor of making the rich ever-richer

the money that funded spacex was stolen from nasa -- much of the money *still* funding spacex is being stolen from nasa in the name of helping prop up the for-profit ""private space industry""

he fixes with the left hand what he breaks with his right and, what, we should celebrate it? 

>*But he tried to help Thai kids trapped underground.*

he screamed at some engineers to build him a child-sized submersible coffin so he could play hero

>*But he's donated money for laptops and clean water in Flint.*

flint wouldn't need his money if we'd been taxing his kind at a reasonable rate

flint wouldn't need his money if he and his kind would stop buying the kind of politicians that let infrastructure and schools rot to save a few bucks

and hell, flint probably wouldn't need his money if we'd nationalized the auto industry decades ago -- it's not too late, let's start with tesla

>*But he's developing affordable solar roofs and revolutionizing tunnel technology and infrastructure.*

which he's using to build a slow, expensive, inefficient subway for those who can afford his expensive, fire-prone cars

A one time donation to one city is nice and all but it’s not a fix to the multi-generational project of educating the entire US population.

Also, you're failing to factor in additional charitable donations he's made, including 480K he donated to Flint schools just back in October.  This latest 423K is in addition to that, so in the last 2 months he's donated 903K to Flint schools.

In September 2017, Musk’s humanitarian efforts included a $15 million donation to the Global Learning XPRIZE.

In October 2017, Musk also used Tesla to help hurricane victims in Puerto Rico. He was among the first to help, sending Powerwall battery systems to help restore electricity. Tesla employees installed the systems, and Musk donated an additional $250,000 toward the disaster relief effort.

In 2015 he donated $10 million to the Future of Life Institute.

Further, he runs The Musk Foundation, his own charity organization.  The Musk Foundation has donated solar-power generating systems in 2010 to the South Bay Communities Alliance Hurricane Response Center in Coden, Alabama. This 25-kilowatt powered system generated 100 percent of the community’s needed electricity.  Back in 2011, the foundation also allocated $250,000 to build a solar power system in Soma City, Fukushima, Japan, after the tsunami.

He has also signed on for the Warren Buffet/Bill Gates Giving Pledge (pledging, along with other billionaires, to give at least half of his fortune to charitable causes), and he serves on multiple boards of foundations and organizations.",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec7ev8s,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec7ev8s/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible. And the altruistic virtues have really prevented the carrying out of this aim. Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good; and at last we have had the spectacle of men who have really studied the problem and know the life – educated men who live in the East End – coming forward and imploring the community to restrain its altruistic impulses of charity, benevolence, and the like. They do so on the ground that such charity degrades and demoralises. They are perfectly right. Charity creates a multitude of sins.”

And an additional word, if I may piggy-back on this:

There is also a catch-22 involved with plutocratic munificence is that the poor must ""perform"" to receive any significant help. If they are not sufficiently impoverished, at least outwardly, they don't even get noticed. If they are too impoverished, they are ignored and forgotten. A balancing act on top of the additional difficulties of not having regular access to fresh food (""food deserts"") or banking services doesn't rise to the level of public aid by a celebrity. Impoverished conditions that fly under the radar and are just as harmful exist all over this nation and rarely make headlines; Appalachia, Reservations, inner cities, and rural farms alike all experience crumbling, sporadic services due to so-called ""necessary cut backs.""

I wish that everytime a corporation got a tax break that the news would cover how many children would lose meal subsidies or how many homeless shelters would have to close or how many drug treatment schemes would be defunded to offset those ""breaks.""",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec81fwe,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec81fwe/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

It's best known for being cold, barren, and flat. So, socialism was the answer I suppose.

Now this government wanted to bring in public health care. Single payer. And they were gonna do it even though the medical establishment, the federal government, the insurance companies, the banks, and the holders of government bonds. They were all dead set against it. 

The right-wing media, which was all the media, was dead against it. They whipped up fake scandals like ""save our Doctors."" Doctors said that they'd burn down their hospitals rather than let the government take it. One of their main, chief arguments?

Charity.

Charity will cover it. We'll take care of eachother. The socialists stood up and said **fuck that.** *We'll* take care of *eachother.* Together. Everyone.

Then the doctors went on strike. They actually did. And the government flew in black doctors who couldn't work in the US. They hired physicians from the UK who couldn't find work due to coming from the (brown) colonies. Women finally got jobs in medicine. They filled the positions, nearly, and broke the doctors' strike.

The system spread across Canada with the support of the unions, who made it basically a political strike issue. But the place where this grand experiment in socialized medicine started? It was a town with a strong labour movement. Now, Saskatchewan is a cold, barren, and flat place, but it's also the site of some brutal battles in the Canadian class war. Strikers were brutally gunned down by the police during a coal strike in the Depression (and coal miners in the Depression fuckined needed to be on strike, mining coal in the depression?!) and the government shot a bunch of unemployed men who were running to Ottawa to ask them to do something about unemployment.

Anyways, what I'm trying to say is the unions didn't get there by magic, it was a hard fight. Anyways^^2 so the town's medical system was all union. The hospital, the clinic, all of it. Owned by the union. Built by workers, for workers, independent of others. Unions came to life out of ""death and benefit societies,"" and unions still helped people with this shit. So when the government rolled out the programme, where did they stick it? The town with the union medical system already set up.

Here is the thing though: obviously corporations try to avoid changes in order to keep running things the way they do - they make use of the system as is (or exploit it, up for debate).

The problem is that the *politicians* should implement changes - no matter how loud corporations cry - and actively  support what is right for society. But as we all know, politicians don't give a shit. They much rather take the bribe not to change anything.

You can't expect every CEO to be a saint - but the people we voted for, their job is to make deals in *our* interest, not line their pockets.

Yet, all the blaming is not doing anything. Instead, people should support a good politician next time they vote and become active as a citizen as well - voting every few years is the absolute minimum in a democracy, everyone should be busy getting informed and staying up to date who is doing what and who and what ideas are worth supporting.

Blaming people like Musk is the easy way - but it won't change shit.",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec7fvsz,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec7fvsz/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

1. Tesla cars are eligible for tax incentives. This is essentially true, but all electric cars are eligible for the same incentives. Tesla just has no ICE cars. Solar panels are also eligible for similar credits, and Tesla installs these as well. These incentives are for the purchaser though, not paid to Tesla. 


2. Tesla received loans from the federal government. This is true again, like several other car companies did. Tesla paid their loan back early though, so it actually paid us more money than we asked for.


3. SpaceX takes money from NASA and the DoD. This is true. This is payment SpaceX receives for providing services like launching satellites and resupplying the ISS. Lockheed Martin isn't being subsidized when we choose to contract them to build a Mars rover just like SpaceX isn't being subsidized when we choose them as a launch provider.


4. All these companies receive tax benefits for locating facilities in particular jurisdictions. This one is definitely true, and it's (unlike the first three) actually a real thing. For example, Texas offered SpaceX $15M in incentives to build a complex in Texas, and local jurisdictions offered $5M more. While this is true and certainly worth paying attention to (and I think eliminating), this is quite standard practice for all businesses. Amazon just got tons of incentives from New York for example to build HQ2 there, even though it sounds like the money wasn't the important part of Amazon's decision.

SpaceX spent years developing the Falcon Heavy and after years of delay it was finally ready for a test flight. This being the inaugural flight they do not fly with a multi-million dollar satellite from a paying customer because there is a possibility that the flight will not go as planned. 

When any rocket company tests a rocket, they still need to test it with the weight of a typical projected payload... the dummy payload is usually a block of concrete. 

Elon Musk thought it would be cool to send up a Tesla in place of a block of concrete, and yes that did generate publicity... but to boil down a project that cost hundreds of millions of dollars into a publicity stunt is misguided.

Ok, let's tackle this:

1. Saying he can take his sub and shove it does not make is at all acceptable for Elon to **repeatedly** call him a pedophile in any sense. So you even defending it slightly is just absurd, honey. Second, the sub was a publicity stunt. It wouldn't fit. Period. There's a reason Money Bags McMakesConstantBadDecisions hasn't taken his useless sub over there and proven him wrong. The route taken, which was deemed the safest route, had everyone going through it one by one and in some places crawling.

2. It doesn't matter if it was just an insult or not. If the man wanted to he could very well have gone after Musk by legal means over it. I was not implying that it was ""anti-Thai"", the man is a U.K. national. It was very much Musk's implication that the only reason people travel there is because they are pedophiles. Nevermind that it is a very big diving destination. Hmm, maybe he's not as well read as all you people like to think. Possibly why his ideas are so dumb.

People act as if he just randomly went nuts and called a ""hero"" a pedo. Let's recap:

1. No, Musk's mini-sub was not used. It wasn't used because the waters had receded enough that it wasn't needed and they were able to perform a much ""dryer"" rescue than they had ever originally anticipated. Why did the waters recede in such an unexpected fashion? It's because they were able to pump out that water much more quickly than predicted... due to drills, pumps, and powerwalls, all sent by Tesla.

2. Yes, all of the media stories focused on the mini-sub while ignoring the fact that Tesla sent all sorts of technology to the scene, without which the ultimate (and much easier and safer for the divers and kids) rescue would not have even been possible as the water level would have still been too high. If you didn't hear about that aspect, then you've been bamboozled.

3. So considering the high probability of the kids (and the divers) dying even with the mini-sub plan (which was still less than if they had to go through high water without it), Tesla's technology likely saved the lives of both groups.

4. Despite this, Musk never once took credit, claimed himself to be a hero, etc. As the existing conventional technology Tesla sent was working its magic, he did nothing but post on Twitter about a possible long shot backup plan just in case that didn't work (which he of course got shit for because he was apparently ""trying to make the situation all about him"", even though nobody is obligated to read his Twitter and millions of other private citizens were also tweeting about it).

5. And on the subject of the mini-sub, he absolutely did coordinate its design specifications with the rescue team, [which has been confirmed](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1016684366083190785/photo/1), so it wasn't even him going off the reservation doing his own crazy thing (which would still be excusable since it was just a *backup* for the *main technology he already sent without which the actual rescue would never have been possible anyway*). They (that is, the people with actual authority over the rescue and not the diver who later mouthed off, who was simply an advisor) *asked* him to continue making it.

6. So what did he get for this? Did he get a ""Thank you for providing the technology that was crucial for this rescue and also for trying to come up with a backup plan even though it ultimately wasn't needed and maybe wouldn't have worked, which doesn't matter since you saved the day anyway.""? No. Instead, everyone focused on the alleged useleness (which we can't even know for sure since it wasn't tried, since it didn't have to be tried because he helped plan A work so well that it wasn't needed) of his backup plan (which once again was only invalidated by Musk's technology allowing the original plan to go so swimmingly). 

7. And then Vern Unsworth, one of the ""divers"" (who actually didn't do any diving for this particular rescue operation and was simply on the scene providing knowledge about his past diving experience there, meaning he probably did less than Musk to save the kids), told him to shove his mini-sub up his ass. Why? What did he do to deserve that attack? Because Vern Unsworth doesn't like the idea of a mini-sub, even though he really had no ability to legitimately judge its viability or not because he hadn't actually even been down in the caves the entire time himself and didn't know what their present condition was like (and had likely never dived with or even seen anything resembling Musk's mini-sub before), even though it was only a long shot backup that even Musk himself had hoped wouldn't need to be used, even though it only ended up not needing to be tried because of Musk's assistance in the first place?

8. Well, if you watch the video of the original interview, Unsworth's motive is clear. You can feel the envious rage radiating off of him. Yes, he *himself* is the narcissist who is mad that Musk got more attention than him. After all, if he was really so worried about the right people getting attention, why didn't he once mention the names of the *actual divers who went down into the caves to save the kids* instead of making the issue all about himself and his feud with Musk (once again, over the high crime of Musk being so helpful that he provided multiple plans that happened to include one that Unsworth doesn't think would have worked)? That's simple: because he wanted to gain attention by accusing Musk of wanting attention.

9. And of course you can add on top of all this the media basically misreporting every facet of the incident/rescue the entire time and thousands of randos piling on to mean ol' Elon Musk (who has the audacity of being rich THAT BASTARD... unlike all of those other rich people who would never even give a single thought to helping anybody ever but of course never get any shit for it because reddit is incapable of learning the names of anyone who isn't mentioned in the Washington Post) on every platform imaginable.

No, calling people pedos isn't a good thing, but you too would eventually snap if you faced nothing but attack after attack after attack when all you were trying to do was help people and got nothing but shit for it (even though you actually ended up saving the day without any credit). Also, Musk eventually acted like the adult and apologized, to which Unsworth responded by suing him for libel.

I'm not a Musk fanboy. Frankly, if even half of the stories about him are true, he sounds like kind of a mess. But I still reach ""LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE"" levels of butthurt about this story because it's just been so shamelessly misreported. I mean seriously, let's not turn the guy into a complete sociopathic suppervillain by endlessly demonizing him over our own persecutory delusions of possibly being emotionally manipulated when he does seem to have many genuine threads of charitability inside of him. The fastest way to kill someone's good will is to give them a ""Fuck you"" instead of a ""Thank you"". Why do that to Musk? There are far worse people out there far more worthy of scorn that haven't received even a tenth of the vitriol thrown at Musk. I don't get it.

A lot of businesses fail because they're not lucky enough - not because they're bad ideas or because they're run badly, but because they're unlucky enough to ramp up only to get taken out by a market downturn, or because they're unlucky enough to have their mad-genius CEO lose his marbles on Twitter *before* Tesla has a dominant position in the market that can support a dip in support from the fear that breeds in investors. Or because they're unlucky enough that their CTO got violently sick on the day of their tech demo for a big investor. Smaller companies are made or broken on the whims of men like Musk, and that really is just a matter of luck.

My point is that there are a dozen other people who have the talent and hardwork that Musk has, but will never been that rich or famous, and it's not because they did anything wrong, exactly.

Not really...both require luck...

I feel like people really have this primordial need to interpret luck as scratching a ticket and winning a billion dollars. 

Elon Musk had roughly the same upbringing most silicon valley leaders had, and it's not 'luck' that most held that same path, the luck was that the path was even present because for the vast majority of people it simply is not. 

Parents who were rich professionals of some kind, almost always at least one who's a professor at a university or a PhD, who had money and access to computers before 95% of people did so they could basically enter the field before other people did. This doesn't mean there was no effort put in part, but that same effort in a family that lacks all of those things would net completely different results. 

Elon Musk: Father literally owned emerald mines, mother has multiple masters degrees. 

Zuckerberg: Upper middle class upbringing, psychiatrist and doctor parents in NYC, including a father obsessed with computers in the pre-PC age. 

Larry Page: Father was a PhD in Computer Science and his mother was a programming teacher when PhD's in computer science were first becoming a thing. 

Sergey Brin: Father was a PhD of mathematics, mother is a NASA researcher, and once they emigrated to the US they were rich enough they could toss him in a ton of private schools. 

Sean Parker: Father was a US Government Oceanographer who programmed and taught him how to, mother was a TV advertiser, once again coming from relative wealth and tons of early computer skills all over before they were popular. 

All these stories tie together a mosiac of resources, parents with graduate level educations that are directly adjacent to the fastest growing industry in the history of the world about 30-20 years before it was accessible by the general public who also had familial wealth to rely on if need be. Even if they didn't use it, the point of getting a safety net that strong is the knowledge you can jump even further.

The fundamental argument made is that Tesla receives a FRACTION of the subsidies that the Big 3 automakers receive, and that's not even diving into the oil industry.

It goes on to detail the fact that of the $2.4B subsidies Tesla has received, $1B are in the form of tax breaks **over 20 years** for building its Gigafactory construction **in Nevada.** The build of the Gigafactory alone has been at least $1.7B, and its development will enable **10,000-20,000 US** jobs that they will give to the state throughout the life of those tax breaks, not to mention after that and the business it will encourage to be done in the US. Finally, Tesla has paid off its govt loan, with interest, ahead of schedule. The argument here is that Tesla is doing plenty to offset if not provide more value than the subsidies.

Basically, I'm confused with your position. If you're against the amount his companies have been subsidized, then you must be REALLY against the Big 3 automakers and all of the oil industry, because they have massive subsidies AND loans that they're collecting. Following that, the subsidies that Tesla has received, and the length of time that they're taking form in, truly truly barely hit your wallet in a significant way - again, you should be much MORE pissed at his bigger rivals if that's your issue. And even if that's your issue, the fact is that Tesla is well on its way, if not already, done paying all of that back to the American people in the form of job creation, doing business in the country (e.g. by building the factory in the US), and quite literally by paying it back with cold hard cash.

Lastly, unless I'm missing something about your opinion above, your stance really just seems downright childish. You're taking the piss out of a person doing an act of philanthropy just because you think you're now personally impacted in some way because of those subsidies. He just as easily could be like ""look at everything I'm already doing for America, I don't have the time to worry about kids in one city."" He didn't just buy laptops for a school district, he gave an entire city's worth of students the power to get more out of their education. Don't forget that the government, and most of the American public, has all but forgotten about the humanitarian crisis going on in Flint. But you're so worried about a couple dollars coming out of your pocket to subsidize a company that has re-energized the idea of American innovation, that you couldn't give two shits about kids who can't even get clean water from their faucets. Let's be honest, if we gave you back your share of the subsidies right now, you wouldn't help kids, or anyone. You'd help yourself. To a big mac I'm guessing.

You're being purposefully obtuse.  Yes, technically you are ""helping"" but paying your taxes because you don't want to incur a fine or possibly go to prison is not the same as charity.

Great.  You'd deserve the praise and that's truly admirable.  There are a lot of people that wouldn't.  Most people I know are not in a position to donate any of their income and that's perfectly fine but they could donate their time and volunteer in some form or another but they don't do that either.

It just is.  We always had more than enough people, we had more than enough hand-me down's and old, possibly broken items donated to us but we didn't have $423k.

I don't disagree with you there, but if kids are literally whacking each other with expensive iPads there is a problem and the problem is that they're spoiled little shits (which, in turn, is the parents' fault).

As a kid, I wouldn't have ever even DREAMED of throwing my Game Boy around. It was precious, I cared for it, and if it broke I knew I would not get another one (if it was on purpose my parents would rightfully give me shit for it, and if it was an accident they didn't have the money to immediately run out and buy a new one). And that's far, far, *far* less valuable than an iPad or a laptop.

Because motive matters.  If I did something bad, would you argue that motive doesn't matter?

In the short term, perhaps, but what happens in the long term?  

I can give you a good example.  Musk's acquisition of Solar city was straight up fraud.  The business was failing, and about to go bankrupt.  It was owned by himself and his family members.  When Tesla acquired it, those worthless shares became valuable shares of Tesla stock.  He could have acquired any number of companies in far better financial shape, or waited until solarcity went through bankruptcy.  But by acquiring it when he did, he acquired the massive debts owned by solar city as well.  Furthermore, the company has nothing to do with the production of EVs, and it's practically a shell at this point. So, why was it acquired at all?  There's only one logical answer, fraud.  

But here is the kicker, Musk had acquired so much goodwill that he basically got away with it scott free. 

That's the danger of buying into propaganda.

Violence and threatening behavior are not permitted, and under no circumstances should you bring a weapon to work. Employees should report to work without being under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol. The use of illegal drugs in the workplace will not be tolerated.

When the prior comment says we ""celebrate elite philanthropy that fulfills basic state roles"", I'm seeing a huge difference in perspective.  
Is providing laptops for students in Flint, Michigan considered a ""basic state role""?  
  
The authoritarian perspective is that the state is the most powerful entity. The libertarian perspective is that the people have the power.  
People like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, having arguably more power than some governments (for example, the municipal government of Flint, Michigan) only exists under the libertarian perspective. Under authoritarian government, it's possible these individuals are just another member of the working class, and not part of the 1%.  
Which I get, you're sitting there saying ""That's the point!"".  
But under an authoritarian system, government is still made up of people. These people have the power, they are the ruling class, the 1%. And it's made up of people who got there through nepotism and bribery. And there's no outside oversight. It's just the government, there's no way to stop the corruption.    
But under the libertarian system, these people, these 1%, are still governed by the rules and laws of the government, which is there to protect the basic human rights of all its citizens. The 1% are not the ultimate authority. Checks and balances.  
  
And I do agree that believing that believing charity is a substitute for social programs is a bit naive.  ",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec8hh16,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec8hh16/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

First, from the perspective of someone who works for the government. It comes down to one word: budget. The whole government operates on given budget, with money dolled out in carefully controlled ways. We *need* to know how much money we're getting ahead of time. Donations don't work like that. The government needs to be able to depend upon a particular amount of money being drawn in from things like income tax. If we regularly offered free ""pay what you want!"" tax schemes, it would be much harder to budget for anything, and the government would become even less effective and even more mired in red tape than it already is.

Yeah, but who pays taxes? Corporations and rich people. They pay the vast majority of taxes in this country. So in effect, when they use technology that was created via government research...they are just getting a return on the research they paid for. It wasn't done out of government benevolence.

> More importantly, we would have a lot more innovators and disruptors if more people could take risks, and fewer people were trapped in cycles of poverty or unable to even try to pursue their ideas because they can't fall behind and lose their job and thus their healthcare and have no way to earn any savings.

Any source for this? Because according to this, you would think most tech innovation would come from the EU, which has a larger social safety net. But actually, the vast majority comes from either the US or China. I get your reasoning and in theory it makes sense..but reality doesn't always back up theory, and it seems in this the results indicate that the theoretical thinking was incorrect: social safety nets don't necessarily lead to people taking more risks.

I agree, it’s tough to escape the cycle of poverty and in an ideal world every person would have equal opportunity to pursue their dreams and make their own impact in the world. We obviously aren’t there yet, but I think we are getting closer. Tech innovation has brought educational resources to the masses at a lower cost than ever before possible due to the accessibility of the internet. 

Before I start rambling, my general thought process is that private entities are generally more efficient at allocating resources to create value for the general public in large part due to the economic incentives put in place vs the “budget problem” where organizations/government goes from the top down, creating tons of inefficiency and waste. Primarily because of that, I generally think when given the choice between private and public solutions to problems, I think it is generally advisable to go private as it is simply generally more “lean” and less wasteful. Of course, checks and balances maintained by a government entity are critical to ensure people aren’t taken advantage of, and there is absolutely not a privatized solution to everything, but I worry about the idea that “socializing” things that can be addressed by the private sector will cause issues down the road, and often times is little more than a bandaid solution.

This is a disingenuous representation though, because the world was a vastly different place. You can't tax corporations at 90%--they'll go elsewhere now (and even back then, there were so many loopholes that very few actually paid that rate).

And the government was spending money on humanitarian efforts in Europe because we had just bombed them and Japan and were helping them rebuild.

The world has greatly moved on since the 1950s. Globalization has changed everything. And we can't leave our economic and tax policy stuck in the 50s, we have to progress it forward to compete on a national stage. The corporate tax cuts last year were a good start, but should have gone further and included more middle class tax cuts, along with slashing unnecessary spending (corporate welfare and other social benefits).",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec8g1wq,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec8g1wq/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

It sounds like we're on track with trying to govern with the least government possible, which is at least a starting point. 

Just some food for thought, but take a look at virtually any other part of a car versus the seat belt. Tires, radio display consoles, engines, windshield wipers, hell just about every part has evolved or gotten better since, say, the 1960's. 

But now look at the seat belt. 

You can't tell me that no car company has ever come up with a better or new design, hell look at the 5 point harnesses race car drivers use. But good old government killed any innovation by regulating the lowly seat belt, and it hasn't changed in 50+ years. I'm sure back in the day people complained that it was ""unfair"" that safety was only for the rich, but the irony is that my grandmother never wore her seat belt because it hurt her somehow (I don't know I was a kid at the time). What's sad is that some company probably could have designed one for elderly people that would have been more comfortable and sure, you would have had to pay for it, but the alternative was ultimately *unsafer* than letting the free market take care of things.

Google provides a *very* reasonably priced admin console to manage them without the need for a local server. They are also entirely cloud based and Google provides schools with unlimited cloud storage. If a device dies we can just hand a student a new one and they are back in action with no downtime and without losing anything. 

Mac and Windows devices are more effort to provision, harder to manage (Apple server, in particular, sucks fucking dick), and they have a lot of local storage so when they die there's a good chance data is lost because students suck at backing things up/ They are also more of a security risk as students love to poke around and try to break into things. 

I can't stress how much I hate Apple server. There are more modernized ways to manage Apple devices than what we do, I know, but we're not investing in a new Apple infrastructure when we're moving away from them so we're just hobbling along with what we have until they are phased out. Deploying software that isn't in the Apple store is a pain in the ass and requires third party software. The keychain is an insecure royal clusterfuck. 

Hell, we just had this mess on our hands this week: We found out that all of these student devices (that were imaged, connected to a throttled provisioning wifi network and then joined to the server, through an admin login, which then pushes down a non-throttled wifi credentials) for some reason pushed the non-throttle wifi password to the local items keychain for the non-administrative student accounts allowing them to easily get access to the wifi password without admin privileges. 

There is absolutely no fucking reason that something like that done through an admin login should be pushing down passwords to a non-admin login that they can read in plain text just by putting in their own password. Yes, there are better ways to manage a wifi network like running RADIUS rather than a PSK but we don't have the infrastructure or money for that and there's no point in setting up a RADIUS server when Chromebooks don't need it because we can push down the wifi credentials from Google Admin that aren't visible to the end user. 

For all the shit Google gets, they are doing wonders to help schools that are financially strapped. ",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec7bhqj,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec7bhqj/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

The guy was himself being a jerk, but that doesn't justify what Musk said. Using Pedo as an insult is  horrendous overkill.

The submarine itself was designed based off of feedback from some of the diving teams associated with the rescue. It also was small enough to fit through the gaps, afaik.

(There definitely is a point to clarifying what the guy said to provoke him. If the guy was just critiquing it like you were then calling him a pedo is a lot different than him starting an insult war. It's not defending him, but I think you know that and you're just saying I am cause you want me to feel bad, idk)

2 Right, my point was that it's not an actual claim of pedophilic desires.

I don't think knowing about diving in Thailand is a requirement for being well read. I don't think being well read is really a thing at all. People can be experts in different topics or know about a variety of things, but there's always something you don't know.

3 (Yo, I love sci-show. Good link) Yea, you're right. Nuking Mars is stupid.

4 The idea is to reduce the chance of accident in the first place and then have the bumper wheels stop them from swerving into the walls, if they don't impact the walls what are they going to run into in those tunnels after all (Possibly a wall right after an elevator). Only autonomous cars will be allowed into the tunnels and only those with the weird bumper wheels. I definitely don't really think they're that close to success yet on the safety end which makes me surprised that Chicago actually selected them for a project. Nonetheless, I think it's great that they're investigating the possibility rather than just looking at it and throwing up their hands. Maybe it is impossible. No one knows yet.

Are you having a fucking laugh? The guy who provided the most information about the layout of the cave complex that directly lead to the finding of the kids did less than Musk? What the fuck are you smoking you thick cunt? Unsworth was a crucial part of the rescue mission.

He's pissed off Musk exploited a tragedy you sycophantic, apologist cunt.


>No, Musk's mini-sub was not used. It wasn't used because the waters had receded enough that it wasn't needed...

It wasn't used because it was a rigid, long, tube of metal. It would have never worked because it could not be maneuvered around the bends in the cave complex. 

>that Tesla sent all sorts of technology to the scene

They didn't.

>Tesla's technology likely saved the lives of both groups.

They didn't send anything stop lying. They didn't save anyones lives.

>he absolutely did coordinate its design specifications with the rescue team

He randomly emailed them and they said, ''Yeah keep going with that.''. Hardly co-ordinating the design there was a back and forth with a few brief emails.

>Despite this, Musk never once took credit, claimed himself to be a hero

He continually kept himself in the news cycle and used it as a PR exercise. He even turned up at the cave entrance and posted it on instagram.

>Instead, everyone focused on the alleged useleness 

It became apparent after the subs uselessness that Musk had exploited the tragedy for publicity. That was why people were pissed off.

UK version is shorter and definitely tons of cringe.  The US mimicked it in the initial season plots which mirrored the UK version.  But once Steve Carrell and other cast members molded the characters more into their own... it became much more lighthearted humor than cringe.


So it's unfair to judge the entire US series if you don't like the cringe based solely on an extreme episode.

It doesn't matter whether they're conservative or liberal, or in a democracy or dictatorship, the rules of power apply to all.

Personally, I do find taxes as technically theft imo because it's property taken without consent, but that doesn't make it any less necessary to maintain our society however. Just because taxes are ""theft committed by the government"" doesn't mean it's not a very necessary ""evil"" to right many wrongs and maintain the best and most free society we can have. It may be a bit of an oxymoron, but it's true. Arguing against all government because taxes is unrealistic and quixotically idealistic.

Without taxes, how will you maintain a government? Without a government, how do you fill the power vacuum and prevent a tyrant or tyrants from taking over? Let's say we go the anarcho-capitalism route, what prevents these corporations that replace government, from joining together and eliminating competition, creating a monopoly, and becoming the government themselves?

Obviously nobody would put up with that. 

But if they say, ""Hey, we aren't stealing from you. We're just collecting funds for a common pool to go toward the common good"" then they will be able to get away with stealing a certain percentage of it while spending the rest on ""common good"" projects that will increase their chances of retaining power. 

The fact that this thread is angry about the lack of government response in Flint is ironic because that is a good example of what I am talking about. The purpose of taxes is to enrich the people doing the taxing, not to provide actual services to people.

capital is money accumulation, or some equivalent (eg gold, land, etc)

thus, accumulation of *right to the rewards of production.*

&#x200B;

That's it. It's that simple. I don't know how it can be seen any other way.

&#x200B;

On the topic of labour: learning, art, building, farming, writing, organising, all of these things are labour. Not many thngs escape the definition of labour since it's about providing true value to society. Automation might make things more complex but ultimately the source of the automation is  human labour. And in the magic capitalist ideal society, the innovators of the machines and the factory owner are the only ones who get the rewards of their systems, so the technological advancement is nonexistent for everyone else, unless it accrues the owners a higher percentage of power. You could also argue that just innate amenities of nature, like water and land, are a produce not made by humans in a meaningful way, which means money is currency for the right to live at that point. 

Curiously, insurance is basically anti-labour as all it does is redistribute money upwards and provide minimal productive value to society, yet insurance companies are ubiquitous within the Fortune 100. It's like ""socialist"" wealth redistribution, except for profit instead of society!

&#x200B;

But all of that discussion of what is production misses the point.

The point is that *money* is not made, it is taken or distributed. The system of money is deciding who deserves more or less, and it's not society that decides, it's those who have the most money, because money is power.

Money is kinda like votes but instead of everyone having 10 votes, the politicians have more votes than the masses, with exponentially more votes if they're higher up on the chain, and everyone needs to spend votes just to live (but the cost is not higher for those with more votes). And unlike in a government, they are incentivised to act  in *complete* self-interest, because that's literally the point of capitalism.",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec8evdz,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec8evdz/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

Hi Vern!

>Are you having a fucking laugh? The guy who provided the most information about the layout of the cave complex that directly lead to the finding of the kids did less than Musk? What the fuck are you smoking you thick cunt? Unsworth was a crucial part of the rescue mission. 

That's arguable, but it's still a fact that he didn't dive.

>He's pissed off Musk exploited a tragedy you sycophantic, apologist cunt.

How did Musk exploit it? By trying to help?

>It wasn't used because it was a rigid, long, tube of metal. It would have never worked because it could not be maneuvered around the bends in the cave complex. 

It's never been tried so we don't know that for sure. You think the world-class engineers at Tesla and SpaceX didn't consider all this? ""Yeah I know we've launched things into space before, but the whole concept of a corner just took us by complete surprise."" And if for some reason it wouldn't work, then it's the fault of whoever sent them the specifications of what they needed. Tesla could have fabricated anything of any shape, size, material, or design. If it wasn't right on any of those counts, then the fault isn't with the people who made it.

>They didn't.

>They didn't send anything stop lying. They didn't save anyones lives.

I linked an article as a reply to somebody else in this subthread with tweets from Elon Musk coordinating the sending of powerwalls and pumps to the scene and there are others if you care to find them. If Musk hadn't even  delivered on the basic things he originally promised, do you think they would have encouraged him to continue his work on the mini-sub?

>He randomly emailed them and they said, ''Yeah keep going with that.''. Hardly co-ordinating the design there was a back and forth with a few brief emails.

You don't think there was more communication between the sub designers and the rescue team? You think world-class engineers don't understand that technology has to be designed in pursuit of a goal, to operate properly in the conditions for which it was designed?

>He continually kept himself in the news cycle and used it as a PR exercise.

The news media kept him in the news cycle. He tweeted (after other people asked him to get involved, mind you), like thousands of other private citizens. Nobody is obligated to read his Twitter. He wasn't making press releases.

>He even turned up at the cave entrance and posted it on instagram.

He turned up after the media had hounded him for weeks about how worthless he and his sub were. Any man would want to prove them wrong at that point. He showed up to exonerate his sub knowing that it would likely give him even more negative PR, not because he thought it'd be a positive PR move.

>It became apparent after the subs uselessness that Musk had exploited the tragedy for publicity.

Once again, how?

Consider this: If Musk was really trying to exploit the situation for PR, then either he or his PR people are absolute morons (since he ended up with more negative than positive PR), much less intelligent than your average reddit genius like you (who so brilliantly and boldly saw through their evil propagandist schemes!), or... he wasn't doing anything for PR and was just genuinely responding to the situation as it unfolded, in his own awkward engineery way.

You say this like it isn't normal for older people to still get angry and explode. In fact i'd say it's more normal for 40 somethings to explode over something than college students. I've always found college students much more relaxed to slights than older adults.

What can I say? Anger makes people do and say stupid things. That's not unique. Imagine spending your time and resources to help someone out only for them to go on TV to basically call you a shit head and to shove your help up your ass.

I mean really how fucking stupid is it to make a miles long vacuum tube in the ground in a state that gets earthquakes regularly...  The hyperloop as it has been touted is not a reality, not to mention the reason for it, being super fast and all is nonsense because you think security takes a long time at an airport, how bout security checks for people getting sent down a massive vacuum tube, the security would be longer than the trip itself.  Also it started as a vacuum tube, now it's a partial vacuum, before long it's probably just going to be an underground maglev, which Japan has already demonstrated can get to around half the speeds of what was originally proposed, but that even doesn't make sense, because when there is air in a tunnel going that fast the air doesn't displace fast enough and builds up in front of the capsule, thus why original ideas for this type of transport back in the 1900's and stuff included big ass fans on the front to break up the air that would gather ahead of it.  Or more sane, just make it a maglev out of a tube like every other sane person and you don't have to worry about that, and don't have to worry about one small shift in the earth causing billions of dollars of damage or nasty buffeting.  


Long story short, no, it's a publicity stunt at this point and being outsourced and pushed out of the limelight with SpaceX taking frontstage because at the end of the day, elon's original plan was something that had been proposed 200 years ago and was right fully shot down as not possible a long time ago.",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec7o51k,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec7o51k/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

But there's no way that Elon Musk would've just gotten a job at a call center if he was born to a family making 50k. 

Why? you seem very certain of this. Ted Bundy had an iq in the 98th percentile and worked a shitty call center job. Ted Kaczynski lived in a shack in the woods and was described by literally everyone who knew him at Harvard as the smartest person they had ever met.

>Would he be exactly the same Elon Musk today? Probably not. But he would almost certainly be extremely successful.

Define 'successful' here. (I'm going to assume you mean money/owning a company) Do you seriously think being raised without having to worry about wealth doesn't have a serious beneficial effect on people? [It demonstrably does.](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/worrying-about-money-can-lower-your-iq)

Do you think the fact Elon's dad was completely loaded played no real role on his ability to take risks, risks that someone with a family who wasn't fully financially secure could never take? [There's serious evidence that behavior viewed as positive when you're rich and white is picked up on earlier and reinforced earlier while it's punished out of younger poorer children of color.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/22/these-kids-were-geniuses-they-were-just-too-poor-for-anyone-to-discover-them/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.50d2149d2b21)

The fact that all these founders have relatively obscure yet similar backgrounds that their parents happen to be experts or have a decent working knowledge of academics and math/computing points to the fact that such a background provided the path needed to out compete everyone else. 

>Another problem with your argument is that genes are inheritable. So if your parents both held PhDs in Computer Science, chances are you'll be extremely intelligent.

There's hundreds of PhDs your parents could have had, the reason that compsci/math was so relevant here and basically a theme with most early silicon valley success stories wasn't 'genes', but rather that most were being taught how to program by their parents and it was being done before the vast majority of programmers even existed AND they grew up without a financial worry in the world with easy access to college and parents who were masters/phds who could guide them along the way in their same chosen field. Programming was simply not something a lot of kids had access to at the time, and the few who had genuine self interest who could, many did not have parents with relevant expertise or even parents with much higher ed at all. 

There's plenty of studies showing the inherited effects of kids with high IQs, but most kids with high IQs don't go on to be as famous or powerful as Elon Musk. His entire personality is shaped by his upbringing. It's a trend, but ignoring that he had to be lucky enough for that path and opening to even exist is divorcing yourself from reality to believe a happier narrative that certain people are just destined for greatness rather than the absolutely unyielding importance of luck, location, and access. 

These are people who got on the ground floor of an entire sector of the economy before it blew up and were in the best position to become rich. These backgrounds aren't coincidences, and they're pretty well linked to the fact that Silicon Valley was most easily seized by people who came from a very specific background that allowed them to enter a market before it even existed, and because software breaks a thousand different rules of business as a concept, they were creating products with near infinite scaling. 

Twenty five years ago if you were one of the smartest lawyers or doctors in the country you would be well off now. If you had access to resources and were one of the lucky people who had the right background at that time and entered silicon valley while the getting was good, you'd be doing a magnitude better than your friends who became doctors and lawyers.

I get that Musk loves talking about how he just bit some leather and forced his way into success, but if he had come from different circumstances, the possible 'success' he'd be aiming for would be considerably less due to access, resources, and upbringing.

> Elon Musk is the sole funder of the Musk Foundation, and has donated at least $257 million to the organization.


He's not the only philanthropist in the world, but my point is that we shouldn't be taking the piss out of great acts philanthropy no matter how rich the person doing it is. $400K+ is a lot of money to do an act of philanthropy with, no matter how rich they are, because the money affects the people receiving it, not the person giving it. Notwithstanding, as has been well documented in this thread that Musk has already made efforts to help with the water crisis in Flint.
I recommend, again, to not treat the world in such a binary way. Companies are not by nature evil, just like acts of philanthropy are not by nature good. We need to be able to support and cheer for the moments that create a better world, and denounce the ones that are, like you said, done for some ulterior motive.
From your words you seem to feel that the world has sleighted you with a bad hand, and you dislike how wealth has been distributed. I can't fault you for that. It sucks. Not everyone wins, and some of us probably deserve to win more than we've been given. But that's life. If what you're saying is true and if you are giving back to your community then you are doing something amazing.

All of us, if we had a microphone/video camera on us for 10% of each day would be up shit creek before we knew what hit us.  It seems to me we all have this desire for people to be perfect in every sense that the minute they aren't, we castrate them.

Yes it does. Putting money towards infrastructure projects or helping the poor pay for food does more both for individuals and for the economy than letting the ultra-rich hoard it does.

> do you think he would not try to avoid that? dont you think it would discourage people from doing things like he does because it would mean he has to pay more?. 

Of course people try to avoid taxes. But they do it with all kinds of accounting tricks and dodges, not by earning less money. (Side note: this is why it's a travesty that we keep taking enforcement funds away from the IRS and telling them to focus on the poor instead of the rich) Higher tax rates don't discourage people from earning more. Unless the rate goes over 100%, you will always still end up with more money if you earn more money.

Also, it's worth noting that the tax rates for the ultra-wealthy are at a historical low. The top marginal rates used to be over 90%! This is how we paid for things like the New Deal and the Apollo Program.",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec7gtto,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec7gtto/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

Seems to be a sort of neo-anarchist utopian ideology that would assume everyone looks out for the country's best interest and we could have all the great laws we want, if the government stopped threatening to shoot, imprison, or whatever. Or more broadly that we shouldn't as a people need a government at all.

You are right that freedom and property rights are strongly linked, but why? What you fail to see (I suppose) is that this logic works because we live in capitalist societies.

In capitalism your property determines your freedom. Have no money, and you have to enslave yourself for some company that not only may be able to profit greatly from you, but than can treat you without dignity or justice, as long as you have no other option. Do you have lots of money?  You can do whatever you want. Bend the laws, destroy other people's lives, you name it. There are no nobility titles, but there is inheritance, which is more or less the same. Why do you think French or American revolutions put all those stress on private property and individual freedom? Because the new laws where written for the rich, who would be the new elite to rule. Liberté: check. Egalité: fuck you, slaves and lowlifes. Fraternité: never seen that, actually.

So, as I said, it's easy to be a libertarian if you have a fair amount of property. It is, actually, the most conservative point of view: the desire to keep your priviledged position, with some abstract justification as ""natural rights"" or fighting against ""tyrants"" (a little anachronistic in this neoliberal world of megacorporations). We should check how many Walmart employees are ready to defend the sacred right of private property as the emblem of justice. It's like serfs defending the bloodline of their feudal lord as granted by God.

A billionaire commiting crimes and going unpunished, that is the true libertarian utopia. The free market of rights, where anyone is ""equal"" in the negotiation table. Imagine what a fantastic world it could be where I could sell my kidney to a millionaire for a pound of rice for my starving family, without the interference of that horrible, tyrannical State. Pure freedom.",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec90b5e,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec90b5e/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

There are societies (like Amazonian tribes) where there is no private property, as everyone can go a feed in the jungle, as resources are abundant. Now, you may say:, Who would want to live like that? They are unable to develop technology! They have to work much more (not really).

True (from a modern, condescending way, at least). But that is not the point. The point is that they are free, and happy living in non-materialistic and non-hierarchical societies (as they low prevalence of mental disease shows). So, now that we know that, we can probably get to a ""modern/technological"" solution without saying ""it will never work, it is against human instincts"" (that the ""primitives"" don't have).

Private property, in our society, is the reason you are not free (unless you are rich). You can't go to the countryside to grow your own crops or build a house (because all land is private), so you must offer yourself for working for someone else, let's say, a landowner. You work the lands but your production is not yours, as the private owner has a divine or legal right (as his grandpa was descended from God or killed some Indians), so he gets a huge chunk of your production. He pays you little enough so you can survive but not accumulate (so you can't retire young). He tells you that you are free, because he doesn't own you, you work because of your free will (because you don't want to die). Meanwhile, he can not work if he has enough land and workers who create wealth for him. He promises ""if you work hard enough, you can be like me one day"". Good luck with that.

Capitalism is the only system where automation, the possibility of not having to work in monotonous or harsh conditions, is seen as something terrible by the workers. That is the freedom that private property gives us.

Those things are largely symbolic. 

if everyone drove smaller cars and went vegan but we kept all the coal/oil/gas power plants we have now... not much would change. 

If everyone kept eating meat, kept the big cars but switched them to electric and the government pushed to swap all power generation to nuclear/solar/wind/hydro/ etc then we would have *mostly-solved the problem.* 

But symbolic things are, by comparison, very cheap.

Wrong. It is possible to have money without having the right to what it can buy; and it is possible to have the right to production output in a barter economy where there is no money.

>capital is money accumulation

Wrong. Capital is wealth used in production.

>or some equivalent (eg gold, land, etc)

Wrong. Land is not capital, since it is not wealth. Wealth is strictly artificial and land is strictly natural.

>I don't know how it can be seen any other way.

I just pointed out four ways you got it wrong, as per *standard classical economics.* If you can't see any other way of thinking of it, something must have been seriously messed up with your economics education.

>learning, art, building, farming, writing, organising, all of these things are labour.

They all *involve* labor. Saying they 'are labor' is a bit misleading. When a farmer plows a field with his tractor, there is labor involved (that of the farmer), but also capital (the tractor) and land (the field, in its natural state). Without the capital, the task would be less productive; and without the land, it would be completely unproductive, no matter how much labor was devoted to it.

>Curiously, insurance is basically anti-labour as all it does is redistribute money upwards and provide minimal productive value to society

If that's all it does, why do people buy it?

>The point is that *money* is not made, it is taken or distributed.

First, it *is* made. (Although not the same way or by the same processes that wealth in general is made.)

Second, I don't think that is the point. Why do you think it's the point? Why the focus on money in the first place? Would reverting to a barter economy solve all these problems?

>The system of money is deciding who deserves more or less

And that's bad?",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ecg1gyb,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ecg1gyb/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

It is absolutely not arguable. He was involved from the very early stages in the rescue mission. His unparalleled knowledge of the cave complex led to the discovery of the children, and their eventual rescue. Without him the success of the mission would have been in doubt. It is outright stupidity to claim that Musk had anywhere near the same impact on the rescue; mainly because Musk did literally nothing. Musk didn't dive either? Yet I don't see you denigrating his efforts. Funny that.

>How did Musk exploit it? By trying to help?

By Tweeting about it constantly in an attempt to make himself seem like some sort of saviour. Let's not pretend his motives were altruistic. If he truly wanted to help he could have did it without the massive publicity campaign he coordinated.

>It's never been tried so we don't know that for sure.

We do know for sure because the cave complex was extremely narrow and tight. So much so that divers were forced to take off their breathing apparatus to get throw the tighter spots. A rigid metal tube a metre and a half in length would not get through. And also the fact that the guy with the most knowledge of the cave complex said it was useless. There is that as well. 

>You think the world-class engineers at Tesla and SpaceX didn't consider all this?

This part is revealing as to the PR motive of the mission. Why would you build a metre and a half long metal tube to rescue kids trapped in a narrow environment? It makes zero sense. It is all fluff.

>then it's the fault of whoever sent them the specifications of what they needed.

Oh so it's the rescuers fault now? Deflect, deflect, deflect.

>Tesla could have fabricated anything of any shape, size, material, or design.

They didn't 'fabricate' anything. They altered a component of something that was supposed to be used on some SpaceX rocket. It wasn't made from scratch.

>Elon Musk coordinating the sending of powerwalls and pumps to the scene

Yeah I read your ''article''. I mean calling it an article is being very charitable. It is a selection of copy and pasted Tweets. There are zero independent sources saying that pumps were sent by Musk. Not one. The only source they were sent is from... Musk himself. 

>You don't think there was more communication between the sub designers and the rescue team?

No. Because if there was they wouldn't have built a rigid metal tube. Also Musk would have published them the same way he published the other emails after his little spat with Vern. They would be out there if they existed. 

>The news media kept him in the news cycle.

He kept himself in the news cycle by continually Tweeting and involving himself in one of the highest profile news stories in the world at the time.  

>He showed up to exonerate his sub

He turned up BEFORE Vern criticised him. Getting your chronology mixed up. Or more likely you don't have a clue what you are talking about. This basically just confirms to me that you're defending Musk regardless of what the facts show. You are defending the indefensible and making shit up as you go. 

>Once again, how?

Because only a moron would build a rigid metre and a half long tube to recuse people trapped in a narrow cave complex.

>If Musk was really trying to exploit the situation for PR, then either he or his PR people are absolute morons (since he ended up with more negative than positive PR)

Just because he fucked up in the PR department doesn't mean he wasn't trying to take advantage of the situation for his own ends. Your logic makes no fucking sense.

>Have you ever thought of that?

Has the realisation sunk in yet that you are here defending a horrible human being, who slandered a hero by calling him a paedophile, while simultaneously denigrating said hero? You literally said that Musk arguably did more to help than a guy who actually WAS on the rescue team, and who's knowledge resulted in the successful rescue operation.

Because that’s all you seem to be able to prove. In case you didn’t understand from before, I’ll state it again in simple terms: Elon Musk is a bad person. 

I don’t agree with his business practices and how he runs his company, that’s why I said he was a horrible business man and person, I’m sorry you were unable to either infer or read through that. 

I care about how he treats his workers and the bullshit he pulls in real life. It pisses me off and I have no idea what he is doing half the time. I would never want to work or do any sort of business with any of Musk’s companies for fear of him screwing me over. 

But he is the only person who is actually putting in the work to improve humanity. 

He is creating the Boring company, a company that is working on creating fast, cheap and efficient underground tunneling and transportation systems, something that costs somewhere from $220 million per mile to $400 million per mile.

He funds the construction and design of the first reusable rockets that land where they are launched. NASA isn’t doing shit about innovating rockets, their funding is too little. He is trying to make space, the final frontier, cheaper for common people to get to. 

He is making hybrid-electric cars that have more tech in them than a household. He is pushing the limits on transportation technology, energy efficiency and environmental protection though this.

Now usually, if I wouldn’t defend someone based purely off of intentions, like if someone intended to bring us to space or improve the environment. But Musk consistently innovates, designs and works towards things that almost no one else is doing at a speed that even less can accomplish. Beggars can’t be choosers and he’s the only person who is getting us close to what will help us.

You have to learn to separate the person from the achievements. 

George Washington founded, objectively, one of the greatest ad most powerful nations to ever be created (at least for a time). And he did more than you would think. He helped define the powers that the states had verses the federal, and was notoriously neutral in politics, so he was the middle man between parties. Without him we would have lost the revolutionary war or the country would have disintegrated into chaos like what happened to the French. 

But at the same time he was a slave owner.

You have to separate the person from the achievements to be able to make great changes in the world. It’s not that the horrible things that they do are forgotten, it’s just that they aren’t tacked to their accomplishments. That’s how people move forward and improve, we aren’t zealots who dismiss anything we don’t agree with. 

So to answer your poor response, I do care about his workers, and I do see them as people. It amazes me what YOU are able to pull out of your ass when you don’t agree with something. It’s just that I’m not looking at what Musk is doing, I’m looking at what he does. I hope he is remembered as a horrible person and a terrible boss, but I also hope he is recognized unbiased for what he has accomplished. 

Tl;dr: It’s less of a “I need to re-examine things in my life” problem and more of a “you need to re-evaluate how you view people and their accomplishments” issue. Maybe a more objective approach and less attacking others and questioning their morals may make people hate you less.",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec9moem,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec9moem/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

The kids get in trouble and she punishes and yells at them and corrects them, but she won't just *not* fix the ipad and *not* give it back to them because she spent so much money to make sure they had ipads in the first place.  So if they're left *not* having ipads, she somehow feels like her investment didn't work out.  It's stupid.  

The kids might be a little spoiled, but they do get disciplined consistently for misbehaving.

You’re clearly not being realistic, since you’re purposefully being dense to avoid accepting the obvious benefit of laptops in a school. Tons of schools have laptops, actually now a days schools have iPads.

>Let me ask you one more question. How old are you? My guess is over 30. Old enough to have never experienced first hand how kids use this kind of tech in schools. Or you are a kid yourself but think you are somehow better than every other kid on the planet.

They had laptops in my school. 

>I do know what I'm talking about because I have first hand experience with this. The computers will have to be replaced for every student because kids absolutely love to break shit. And the ones who don't love to break shit will do it anyway because they are careless.

Nope, totally false. At worst, I mean absolute worst, 10% of the laptops get broken. And one again, who cares if they break. Should schools not have pencils because kids sometimes snap them? 

>Nope. It will be during all the time they have their laptop because games are addictive and kids are more addicted to them now than ever before.

Ok, but it doesn’t matter, because all a teacher needs to do is walk around the class and take the laptop of anyone playing games. Or download software that lets them see the screens of every connected computer.

Even if kids abuse them by playing, it doesn’t matter, because the benefit of laptops for learning is far greater. As I already listed, funny how you abandoned the argument there are cheaper more effective methods lol.

>The cheapness does matter because they will get broken. Try to keep up.

Did you misstype? If they’re cheap then repairing them isn’t a problem. Notice how when I told you to keep up it’s actually because you’re having trouble comprehending things.

3) G.E. says they paid $1b in income taxes in 2010 and unfortunately there is no evidence that’s not true

4) most of the benefit was due to carried forward loss from the financial crisis. I’m a fan of adjustments for carrying forward losses

Just imagine we use all that money and buy lottery tickets. I mean, someone has to win, am I right?

Personally, if I could controll it: 

Magad. 

Meaning, make america great again, damn it. 

- forcefull closure of the war on terror, and getting the troops home to get you the initial money. 

- Then, use the money you would save on just the war on terror to invest in infrastructure. 

- start with, every troop in service now gets a job training in infrastructure construction. Make it part of the PT regimen. Instead of staying on base, and doing PT, pay the troops 2-4 dollars extra for their PT, ship them out, have them jogg down a highway, and just pick up trash. I bet a lot of military troops would be happy for the extra pay and the low risk. 

- Then, the on the job training. Train the soldiers so they have the manuial qualifications to do a trade. Mostly, related to maintaining the fucking infrastructure. 

- invest a couple of millions into a special fund to loan money to soldiers who want to start infrastructure maintennance companies. 

- Then, get the army corps of engineers, and set them on the task to renovate things. Start with the big cities, and the smallest hamlets. see what they need, pay for the initial setup, and then have a contract for the community to maintain, using the money saved from the war on terror. 

- have the army corps of engineers run those building sites, and create actual training battallions. Just people learning how to do roads, how to operate machines, ect. As many people as possible. We can bet that if you train 100 people how to maintain that infrastructure that is being built, at least 2-3 will start a company and bid for the contracts to maintain what was being built. And whom better to hire to maintain infrastructure built by the military then military? Abnd the second where every arm,y soldier is as well a qualified tradesmann, you have made a huge leap in the right direction. 

- In the beginning, the project will write red numbers for a long time, but towards the end, we will see how the ammounted monetary benefits of completely pay for themselves. Make it via a list. The list gets every city in america on it, and what it needs. It gets randomly populated,. and the cities can bid or pre pay for their position on that list. A few smaller communes will drop out, bigger cities will appreciate the cheap labor. But the second all those communities that were being renovated see the influx of new people, dedicated to maintaining that infrastructure, and spreading the wealth they get around, people will want that for themselves. 

and THEN, once america has a leg to stand on, a good wellregulated infrastructure, with sufficient room for growth, and maybe, if you want to make me extra happy, sufficient trains, THEN you allow the space race, nasa, ect to pick back up.

There is a physical requirement for the right of free speech. You cannot physically stop anyone from saying anything. Thus it is a natural right.

Clean water is not a human right because there is nothing in nature that guarantees clean drinking water. And clean drinking water not required for survival, what is required is water in general, or some liquid that contains it. However pollution does lead to negative effects on the safety of the water, but then it is the job of those that consume that water to clean it, and the responsibility of those that might pollute it to try not to do that.

A natural right is something that is inherent to human nature, humans have a tendency to express themselves how ever they wish, thus free speech and expression is a natural right. Same thing goes for the right to self defence, we have an instinct to protect our selves and our friends and family, thus we have a natural right to defencive actions, even killing an attacker. Anything that is linked to how humans behave independently is a human right. Free expression, free association, freedom of movement, the right to property, there right to defend yourself; all these are inherent human rights that can not be restricted. They are the definition of free will. 

And I sure as hell don't want to limit your freedom, you're however misconstrueding a right and a privilege of modern society. Clean drinking water is almost universally a privilege of modern free society.

If I steal your car but leave behind a lifetime supply of a prescription drug you need to live, it was still theft, even though depending on your economic struggles the gift I left might have made it forgivable. Nevertheless it's still theft. 

You say I consent to the taxes by living in society and benefitting from it, but that's the thing. By that logic, a dictatorship having a workers hand chopped off for stealing bread because they were starving wasn't really an assault of any sort. After all, they totally consented to living under that dictatorship and its rules by living in it, didn't they?

I didn't choose to be born here. And while it may be theoretically possible for me to live totally off the grid, I could not legally do so without having to earn money, some of which goes to *taxes*, and some to social security rather I like it or not, so that I could pay for permits from the government to legally fish and hunt to sustain myself. 

These of course are also necessary for our society just like taxes are, otherwise people might overfish and overhunt etc. However no matter how much you argue to the contrary there is nothing voluntary about taxes at all and it is therefore a theft.

But you have not offered anything as a counter to this, just a simple “nu-huh!” That’s not an argument... neither positive or negative.

As for Marxism being tried, it seems a bit narrow minded to assume that the only type of socialism possible is the socialism of the 20th century. Even so, none of those were truly Marxist. Even the bolsheviks, the true socialist party that was co-opted by the soviets, knew that their movement was a placeholder, as it where. If you study the writings of Marx, you can see that true socialism requires several things to succeed. One being that the revolution takes place in the industrial center of the world (which would have been Germany at the time). Another being that it must completely abolish the capitalist system before attempting to establish a socialist one.

It is possible to have money without having the right to what it  can buy; and it is possible to have the right to production output in a  barter economy where there is no money.

That's being nitpicky at best. I'm not claiming you have the right to things that aren't being sold but the right to have a greater or lesser amount of purchasing power than others based on how much money you have. I suppose in hindsight I should have just written it as ""purchasing power"". The point of my claim is the distinction between money and actual production because those who create real value aren't given the actual equivalent in money almost ever, and that's the problem.

>Wrong. Capital is wealth used in production

Yeah, by the economist's terms, not the layman usage of capital, which is synonymous with wealth. Land, gold, etc are things owned by people, even if they are natural/non-artificial, and as such are still part of a person's accumulated assets and tools of power.

>If that's all it does, why do people buy it?

Because they literally have to due to the exploitative systems in place? ""Why do people do bad things for themselves in a system that forces them to do bad things for themselves"" is pretty much what you're asking. Insurance companies have the power to write laws, hire lawyers, lobby the government, exploit everything. It's how they run. They make themselves better than the alternatives by either making the alternatives much worse or completely illegal. People joke about big Pharma but it's all big Insurance, really.

>First, \[money\] *is* made.

N..no it's not.. unless you consider the government manufacturing notes as ""making money"". But the participants in the capitalist system aren't making money. They're redistributing it. That's literally a fact. And if people were *making* money, then the system would collapse from inflation and lack of faith in money because it's artificial. It has to be established by institutions or it just doesn't work.

>And \[wealth-based inequality is\] bad?

Pretty clearly, yes. Money = power, regardless of how you complicate the definitions, and more power leads to more power. The system incentivises accumulation and protection of power, so those in power act out of selfishness rather than the needs of society. Plus, there's no justification for it because it biases people towards not just the exploitative nature of money but even in a super-hypothetical non-exploitative system money still doesn't work as a universal value, so certain behaviours are disproportionately retributed. It sets an arbitrary metric for who gets better lives than other people, and focuses also too much on the lives of individuals when humans are members of communities and society.

There's also the data correlations of inequality and problems like crime etc that are completely dominant, stronger than actual wealth and other variables. EG an area that has people making on average very little money but almost everyone makes the same amount often has much less of these problems than one where the average person makes a lot of money but the inequality is very intense.

Plus the data that shows that the economic elite have an empirically disproportionate affect on policy that renders the populous practically powerless.

It's clearly broken because the system of supply and demand is entirely exploitable because you can cultivate demand and control supply to focus on profits instead of satisfying the natural desires of the public. It's like if instead of having a government coordinate production on representative behalf of the votes and voices of the communities and societies locally and nationally in order to provide amenities and advances to the public,

you make it a for-profit system where your ""government"" *tells* the people what they want and the incentive of the people in control is to gain power, not satisfy the needs of society.

Also I don't know where you got the idea that I was arguing for a barter system instead. That's a weird stretch.

Walmart is the same way. They have more money than could ever reasonably be spent. And instead of using that to make the lives of their employees better, they hoard it at the top and let them use food stamps to survive.

There is simply no reason to have billionaires in the world. They hoard their money and trickle it out on whatever they want. This keeps absurd amounts of money out of the economy and makes it harder for everyone else to gain wealth. The sad part is this quest for wealth makes no difference on their lives.

>By Tweeting about it constantly in an attempt to make himself seem like some sort of saviour. Let's not pretend his motives were altruistic. If he truly wanted to help he could have did it without the massive publicity campaign he coordinated.

Tweeting on his private account is not trying to make himself look like a savior or a ""massive publicity campaign"". And you ignore that he only started tweeting about it after *others* tweeted at him about it. You're twisting the facts to fit your narrative.

>We do know for sure because the cave complex was extremely narrow and tight. So much so that divers were forced to take off their breathing apparatus to get throw the tighter spots. A rigid metal tube a metre and a half in length would not get through.

It may have depended on the conditions. We don't know. I do know that the employees of SpaceX/Tesla are definitely better designers/engineers than you or me so there must have been some logic to what they were thinking, unless they were misinformed which isn't their fault.

Tweets are good enough sources for you when you're using them to vilify Musk, but not when others are using them to defend him. Hmmm...

>The only source they were sent is from... Musk himself. 

If Musk had lied about sending them, don't you think that people like you and Unsworth would have rushed to call him out?

>Also Musk would have published them the same way he published the other emails after his little spat with Vern. They would be out there if they existed. 

That's your baseless speculation. He could have been advised by his legal team or others not to do so.

>He kept himself in the news cycle by continually Tweeting and involving himself in one of the highest profile news stories in the world at the time. 

I'm sorry, I must have missed when Elon Musk became a news editor and chose to publish stories about his own tweets.

>He turned of BEFORE Vern criticised him.

I never said otherwise. From my prior post:

>He turned up after the media had hounded him for weeks about how worthless he and his sub were.

I said ""the media"", not Unsworth. Learn to read.

Neither of us are pedos (as far as I know.....), and even if we were, we're both anonymous to one another.

When Elon Musk, a person who is equal parts wealthy, powerful, and popular, who also has a track record of making flippant, non-factual statements on Twitter, calls somebody a pedophile, I'm going to assume he's lying. Because he's lied before. Liars lie. I'm willing to have my mind changed. But in absence of the evidence that would require, I'd argue that assuming Vernon Unsworth's innocence is not baseless.

Those (rare) societies with no private property exist, existed for millennia, and don't have scarcity problems nor go extinct. And I don't know how you could define freedom in a way that doesn't apply to them, as they don't even have state or authorities. If they are not free, no one has ever been free ever in history.

Again, the example of a landowner: you sell part of your production, you say. In exchange for what? Right to work. Where do the rights come from? Ultimately, violent appropiation of land that was communal. Even if it was ""legal"",  a state was there  to defend that legality by force. Private property is, thus, determining that one person works, and other lives without working, thanks to what he is ""paid"". The rich can decide that the land is to be his untouched garden and you will die of hunger, as you are not free to work.

And automation. Are you going to tell me no one is worried about unemployment, or that only idiots would care about that? Even the factory owners know that huge unemployment is bad for them. But sharing their wealth is against the *divine private property* and they will fight it to the end.

I am not saying pre-agrarian societies are an utopia, or that we should renounce to modernization. No one says that except for ultra-conservatives. I am just saying that private property is the root of an unequal society, and that most of the world is given breadcrumbs to be kept submissive.

1. You can absolutely physically be stopped from using your free speech.
2. If ""being unable to be physically stopped"" is a requirement for a right, than most of our rights protected by the constitution are not rights, because they can all easily be physically stopped.

Except that our bodies require it. So, even though non-clean drinking water exists everywhere, for us to exist, clean drinking water must exist.

This argument easily implies that ""might makes right"" and ""if you want to do something, it must be in your nature, and therefore you should do it"".

You're basically arguing that everything is a right, because if we want to do it, it must be in our nature. It's a tautological argument, and it's useless and dumb.

Take your own advice. Taxes are a contract you've agreed to by taking the job you took. Because that job only exists because of the infrastructure provided by the government that collects taxes from it and you.

To claim taxes are theft is like getting in on a deal for goods, then refusing to pay. You already utilize the contract. You went to school, your use roads, the police protect you, etc. 

Actually, to claim taxes are theft is the most Trump thing ever. He always reneged on his contracts. 

If you don't like the contract, you can change it. But if you want to live in a place without that contract, I hear Somalia is a terrible place to live.

No, I really don't think it is. I've repeatedly seen people stating all sorts of bizarre conclusions about money based on ignoring exactly these details.

>The point of my claim is the distinction between money and actual production because those who create real value aren't given the actual equivalent in money almost ever, and that's the problem.

That's pretty much literally the opposite of what you just said, though.

>Yeah, by the economist's terms

'Capital' is an economics term. The economics definition is kinda the one to use.

>not the layman usage of capital, which is synonymous with wealth. Land, gold, etc

As I just said, land isn't wealth.

>Because they literally have to due to the exploitative systems in place?

Which systems? How would insurance become pointless if those systems were eliminated? Can you somehow abolish luck?

>Insurance companies have the power to write laws, hire lawyers, lobby the government, exploit everything.

And if they didn't, nobody would ever buy insurance?

>N..no it's not.. unless you consider the government manufacturing notes as ""making money"".

I do. But most money isn't made that way. Most money is made by banks using fractional-reserve banking. (Basically, they lend out more money than the actual amount of currency they possess.)

>Money = power, regardless of how you complicate the definitions, and more power leads to more power.

Money is, at best, a *kind* of power. Saying 'money equals power' implies that all power is money, too, which is false.

Imagine if I said 'apples = fruit', and then proceeded to conclude that banana cream pie is technically a form of apple pie. You see how silly your conclusions can get if you're not careful with your logic.

In any case, it's not clear why that would be bad. Isn't having more power a *good* thing? Isn't that what civilization is for?

>The system incentivises accumulation and protection of power

That's not 'the system'. That's literally how the Universe works. It's true in *any* economic system. It's more fundamental than economics.

>so those in power act out of selfishness rather than the needs of society.

Is it important that they act according to 'the needs of society'?

>There's also the data correlations of inequality and problems like crime etc that are completely dominant, stronger than actual wealth and other variables.

Correlation does not imply causation. Do you have any sort of actual mechanism in mind for this? (And even if you did, can you justify taking someone's wealth in the name of reducing crime?)

>Plus the data that shows that the economic elite have an empirically disproportionate affect on policy that renders the populous practically powerless.

That's a government problem, not a wealth problem. It only happens if you already have a corrupt political system anyway. And if you have a corrupt political system, it doesn't really matter what else you do, you're going to have problems. If anything, wealth inequality is a consequence of political corruption, rather than the other way around.

>the system of supply and demand is entirely exploitable because you can cultivate demand and control supply

Can you? How? What's the mechanism?

And what on Earth do you have in mind as an alternative? If the economy is not supposed to respond to supply and demand, then what *is* it supposed to respond to?

>to focus on profits

Controlling supply generates rent, not profit.

>Also I don't know where you got the idea that I was arguing for a barter system instead. That's a weird stretch.

It's because you were saying money was somehow a bad idea.

This is so sad, the article literally proves that private money is more effective than government money. You can bet Elon Musk spends his money more carefully than the government spends other peoples'. 

Regardless, there is no reason private money can't help the needs of most people with government filling in the gaps. Certainly no reason for government to spearhead the effort or take on the lion's share of the work. There is plenty of money and plenty of generous people ready and able to help.

It certainly does. He is one of the few people in a position to cast judgement on Musk's efforts. Completely different to the point you originally made though. I don't know what you mean by 'other people involved in the rescue'. He attacked Musk, and Musk wasn't involved in the rescue at any point. 

>Other than help eliminate the biggest enemy of the rescue (the rising water) much faster than would have otherwise been possible...

Source on that?

>You're twisting the facts to fit your narrative.

Irony isn't lost on you is it?

>It may have depended on the conditions.

To quote Vern Unsworth. It had 'no chance of working'. Considering he has a much better knowledge of the cave complex than you, me, Musk, or any engineer I would be inclined to trust his judgement. 

>If they weren't clear about their requirements, it is.

Well they rescued the children successfully, so I'm going to assume that whatever measurements or factors they were using in their own rescue efforts were accurate. This is the thing I don't get with you. They successfully rescued the children. Yet you are casting aspersions on their judgement, and on their efforts. Actually read over what you have written. It is nonsensical.

>Tweets are good enough sources for you

No they aren't. Using tweets to back up a statement of fact is completely different from using Tweets to garner publicity. If you don't see the distinction in that then you are a lost cause. Speaks volumes that the only 'source' (and I use that term loosely) is some random article with copy and pasted tweets from random people. Half of the tweets are from Musk himself. 

>I must have missed when Elon Musk became a news editor 

He knows how to keep himself in the news. I'll give him that at least, he's pretty good at promoting his brands. 

>I never said otherwise.

You said he went to the cave to 'exonerate his sub'. He only tried to defend the sub AFTER Vern had criticised it. So yeah, your chronology was wrong. There wasn't much, if any, media criticism of his efforts until after the Vern interview and he called him Pedo guy. So saying 'the media had hounded him for weeks about how worthless he and his sub were' is another outright untruth. Learn to read. 

>So the indefensible is

Defending the indefensible is making excuses for a multi-billionaire slandering someone involved in a rescue effort with baseless accusations of paedophilia just because he got his feelings hurt. You can try sarcasm all you want. What you are doing is disgusting.

Is anyone who opposes your opinion instantly a horrible person because you are the most correct person ever with perfect opinions? Are you the paragon of morality, able to deem people horrible based off of how they speak? 

You don’t know me, you only know my view point on this one topic that literally means nothing in either of our lives.

Neither of us are wrong, it’s an opinion. However, what can be gathered from this pathetic internet exchange (I’m talking about both you and me being pathetic, don’t be too insulted) is that you’re a prick. 

So far, I haven’t made any unfounded assumptions about you, I just said you don’t care about things Musk is working for as much as he does, which is undeniable because, objectively, he is on the cutting edge of the fields he funds and develops and you are willing to dismiss what he has done simply because he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. I also said that people would hate you less if you responded differently to things instead of just insulting people because they have different opinions. 

I haven’t really made any stretches when addressing your character and what you believe. But you do just that, insulting me without addressing any of the points I bring up. 

This kinda displays that you have nothing real to say, only that we differ in values and opinions, and that’s perfectly fine. Just don’t be a prick about it, admit that some of my points are correct, prove where I’m wrong and show me where we can compromise. Don’t just take one line that I typed poorly, and use that to dismiss everything I say. 

So say something. Respond and express your point, I have no idea where you stand and I am genuinely interested why you believe what you believe in and why you react so dickishly to anyone that believes otherwise.

Interesting you want to go down that road. Since you brought it up, onviously no OEM hits the same percentage because no other oem is electric only. If you're not looking at percentage, every other oem is better at production of cars in general than Tesla. They are slow and underdeliver.

It's middle school logic that is utterly meaningless. If someone makes a claim, it's up to them to support that claim. Without evidence the claim can safely be dismissed.

Clearly, since Musk failed to provide any evidence to support his childish name-calling, he has none, and his ridiculous allegation can be dismissed.

I understand that reddit is a bubble where you can go to be surrounded by other people with your same viewpoints and feel legitimized, but I'm hoping that you can open your mind one day to think outside confirmation bias.

I'm sorry, but this is just childish. How do you you plan on delivering that food waste to someone so that it is edible and doesn't kill them? There are millions of people and businesses trying to reduce waste - i mean, lordy, waste is WASTE. it's costly. You act like people are just trying to throw away trash, but that's not at all how it works. Waste is waste because we don't know how to use it more profitably.

&#x200B;

We also don't have an overabundance of resources right now - where on earth did you get that idea? Life is a differential equation - we make as much product as is demanded for consumption, and if demand grows or shrinks, we adjust supply accordingly. Do you think that rolled steel just sprouts out of the ground?

&#x200B;

Food waste, for example, is a crazy complex issue. Consumer behavior, food labelling that makes people think food has gone bad, farming processes, safety regulations, etc. etc. etc. all lead to a sub-100% yield from food production. Your inability or unwillingness to engage with reality, and instead create strawmans, is probably why people don't want to engage with you.

&#x200B;

Here's the same topic with another perspective - did you know that an incandescent lightbulb ""wastes"" 90% of its energy as heat, and less than 10% is actually light? Why are you wasting all that energy you slob?? we live in a world with an overabundance of energy, yet millions of people every day are struggling to stay warm. Why are you WASTING that heat when people need it? Did you switch from incandescent to CFL? Good for you. You're still ""wasting"" 30% of that energy to heat. But good luck doing something with it. 

&#x200B;

Hopefully you can see how absurd the ""waste"" heat example is. Hopefully you understand that analogy. I would advise a bit more measure in your attitudes and opinions. Obviously we get more and more efficient as we become more technologically advanced - but your perspective is simply wrong.",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec9fb3w,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec9fb3w/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

you don't know how free will works do you?

""you can cut off my hands and my feet, but as long as i live, i can still speak""

where there is a will there is a way... no exceptions. 

>If ""being unable to be physically stopped"" is a requirement for a right, than most of our rights protected by the constitution are not rights, because they can all easily be physically stopped. 

again, you can't physically stop anything a human wants to do. speek, defend themselves etc. if you can't control what someone does, you can't physically stop them from doing it. you can't control speech, all attempts to control it have failed, and will always fail. all attempts to control what people own fail, and will always fail. all attempts to control what people do, fail and will always fail. no amount of Physical force is going to stop anyone from doing any of these things. the drug war failed, censorship fails, there is no way anyone can control what you say or do. this is why it is physically impossible to control what people say, do, or how they even act or think. 

> Except that our bodies require it. So, even though non-clean drinking water exists everywhere, for us to exist, clean drinking water must exist. 

Again this is wrong. you don't need clean drinking water to survive. here is a bit of anecdotal evidence, I survive on pretty much milk and apple juice alone. i don't NEED clean drinking water to survive, i only need some form of liquid with water in it, food, and depending on the environment shelter, and clothing, but the last two are human inventions and can be had for free, if you know how to hunt/gather and build a shelter. 

> This argument easily implies that ""might makes right"" and ""if you want to do something, it must be in your nature, and therefore you should do it"". 

that's a misrepresentation of my argument. when it comes to EXPRESSION, not particular actions, humans tend to express themselves in anyway they can. might does not make right, because the second you interfere with someone else's rights to life, liberty and property, you have committed a crime, which even if there isn't a government you are likely to be punished for. you can't express yourself by murder, that's going to get you killed at worst, exiled or imprisoned at best. 

> You're basically arguing that everything is a right, because if we want to do it, it must be in our nature. It's a tautological argument, and it's useless and dumb. 

i'm actually not. again, i'm arguing that you can't control what people say or do, we haven't even gotten into what you can do in the presence of other people and how your rights interact with theirs. my whole argument assumes a singular person not interacting in any meaningful way with another human. this is why i stated ""individual"" somewhere within my arguments. 

and if you read this section of my first reply:

> The only human rights are the rights to life (protection from harm by another person), liberty (the right to say and do what you want as long as it doesn't violate others rights) and the right to property (the right to hold and keep possessions without someone taking or destroying them). 

then you should realize this all hinges on individual rights, of which you can not violate others. 

&#x200B;

 There are no natural rights. Nature doesn't give a shit about your free speech. Rights are whatever society gives them to you. 

to state this is to state that you don't believe in free will. that whatever you do is controlled by what others think of rfeel or an all powerful force that controls everything. this is can be objectively disproven. there is no scientific evidence of a god, or a hive mind in humans. if anything all evidence suggests that there isn't. social behaviors aren't always universal, and people don't always react in the same way. while some people run away from gunshots, others run towards or perpendicular to them. while some people will clap because others are clapping, others will not clap at all unless someone deserves it. there are sheep in human society that just follow what others are doing, however this isn't the norm. it's actually not normal, everyone has an individual will and desire. some people want to be heros, some people want to be accepted, some people want to be different or appear as an outsider. there is free will, no one can control what you say or do. not physically not mentally. there is no way to control any of that. this is why free speech is a right, a natural right, this is why governments and society doesn't actually control what you do personally. your will to be accepted, your will to be normal, that's what drives any person to fit in or say what other people are saying. i personally don't want to be normal, nor do i want to be accepted, i want to be free, not shackled to what society says is ok. this is why i'm just a:

No. That's just.. false. Completely. Are you okay?

>As I just said, land isn't wealth.

Great job dodging the point by continuing to nitpick and ignore the greater context I provided specifically responding to this very statement you made.

>Which systems? How would insurance become pointless if those systems were eliminated? Can you somehow abolish luck?

? Insurance is the responsibility of the government. Having profit as a factor in a 'socialist' system like insurance is bad for the exact same reason that profit incentive is bad in the government.

>Money is, at best, a *kind* of power. Saying 'money equals power' implies that all power is money, too, which is false.

You make nitpicking into an artform, mate. Missing the point completely has to be your goal here. I'd take pride in that.

>Isn't having more power a *good* thing?

Do.. do you think power is value? You must have REALLY missed the point, because finding a common definition of power here, unlike previous things you've said, isn't nitpicky, because ""Power"" being equated to value is INCREDIBLY stupid.

Power is just agency over yourself and other people. Those with more power have more control over their and others' lives than other people do. That's what it means. That's probably why you're having such a brainfart here is just that one mix-up on its own.

Unless of course you think accumulating control over other people's lives is a good thing. With the obvious implicit cost of their own control over their lives. Because that's what power is. Is civilization for the exploitation of people? Is that the ultimate goal of humanity? That's where you're inevitably lead with that train of thought.

>Is it important that they act according to 'the needs of society'?

Yes? How could it not be essential that people act in the interest of society rather than against it? Considering money is the major vector of power right now, this means people who have disproportionate impact on others' lives through this mechanism ought to be held accountable. Not a crazy view to have.

>That's a government problem, not a wealth problem.

Chicken and egg. Political corruption exists because of incentive to be 'corrupt'--in this case, it's wealth-based. And the major vectors of the corruption in our system are corporations affecting politics fairly directly. The solution to the problem is better government regulation and stronger disconnect of politicians from the economic system so A: that they can't exploit their roles to gain profit and B: moneybags don't have disproportionate representation to the populous. That's a government *solution* for a *capitalist* problem. Unless, of course, you have the mentality that profit incentive is a universal good, then you actually pretty much have to accept that the ""corruption"" means the government is working as it should.

Even if the government is fundamentally in perfect order, those with more money can indirectly impact the government through their affects outside of it. So it really is ultimately a capitalist problem.

>(And even if you did, can you justify taking someone's wealth in the name of reducing crime?)

Considering we established that wealth isn't earned but distributed, yes. Yes we can. Rich people whining about losing ""their"" wealth is the same as having a politician whine about losing their political power over people. Bringing them down to our level is the *point.* If you *having* something is hurting other people, then maybe you shouldn't have it.

>""the system of supply and demand is entirely exploitable because you can cultivate demand and control supply""  
>  
>Can you? How? What's the mechanism?

Advertisements, social engineering, monopolisation (which in modern contexts often involves coordinating so that you aren't technically a monopoly). Good examples being diamonds, and ""breakfast food"".

People's lives are completely wrapped in corporate elements with which you can tweak all the knobs to get them to pretty much do what you want. It's not mind control but it's life and environment control to an excessive degree. There's also the huge information control factor, which is the modern problem.

>It's because you were saying money was somehow a bad idea.

No. I was explaining how money is not equitable to your value and how it's exploited, not that """"""money is a bad idea"""""". That's a pretty gross misreading of my discussion. Inequality is the problem. Money is not the problem. If everyone had the same amount of money there would be no \[economic\] inequality. Society would still develop fine.

&#x200B;

But, realising that you don't understand what ""Power"" is explains everything. None of our discussion is relevant at all once I acknowledge that problem.

""Profit"" is a nebulous term. It means Revenue - Expenses, but because expenses are wide and varied, you can control what your profit looks like. If we switched to taxing revenue instead of profit, companies would adjust, and we'd get more provable, consistent taxes from them. I'd bet the actual effective tax rate could go down, because all of the companies cheating the system and claiming they made no profit would actually have to start paying taxes again, which would increase tax revenue, and reduce strain on the budget.

Unless I'm misinterpreting your terms, you said that money represents the right to produced goods, and then you said that it's a problem when people aren't given as much money as what they produce. The second statement seems to presuppose a right to money (and therefore to produced goods) that extends beyond the possession of money. That strikes me as inconsistent.

>Great job dodging the point by continuing to nitpick

This isn't nitpicking. It's important.

>and ignore the greater context I provided specifically responding to this very statement you made.

What response? The world 'land' literally appears only once in your post.

>You make nitpicking into an artform, mate.

This isn't nitpicking. It's important.

>Missing the point completely has to be your goal here.

If there's a valid point to be made, you should be able to make it without having to resort to equivocation fallacies.

>Do.. do you think power is value?

No.

>Power is just agency over yourself and other people.

I find that a poor definition. It doesn't include any agency over anything other than people.

But if we take your definition for granted, then it raises some questions: Are 'yourself and other people' grouped together here, or separate? (That is to say, if you have *only* agency over yourself, do you have any power?) And how does the 'money is power' thing fit into this?

>How could it not be essential that people act in the interest of society rather than against it?

Does society have an 'interest', separate from the interests of the individuals in it? And if it does, why is it important that we act according to the former rather than the latter?

>Political corruption exists because of incentive to be 'corrupt'

Yes, but not *only* that. It also exists because there are people *willing* to be corrupt, and because other people are not willing (or not able) to stop them.

>so A: that they can't exploit their roles to gain profit

Why? Isn't more profit a *good* thing?

>That's a government solution for a capitalist problem.

It's not a 'capitalist problem'. You're just throwing 'capitalist' in there arbitrarily.

>Unless, of course, you have the mentality that profit incentive is a universal good, then you actually pretty much have to accept that the ""corruption"" means the government is working as it should.

I don't see how you figure that at all.

>Considering we established that wealth isn't earned

I don't think we've established anything of the sort.

What do you think the criterion for 'earning' is? That is, theoretically speaking, how would earning something be possible? And why do you conclude that wealth is never covered by that criterion?

>Bringing them down to our level is the point.

That seems like an awful kind of point. Do you really look at the poorest people in our society and think that the goal of our economic system should be to make everybody exactly that poor? I don't think I can get on board with that. I want people to become richer, not poorer.

>If you having something is hurting other people

Having wealth doesn't hurt other people.

>Advertisements

People can choose whether to respond to advertisements.

>social engineering, monopolisation

Maybe you should do something about *those* rather than trying to eliminate the system of supply and demand (since the latter is basically futile unless you exterminate humanity).

>There's also the huge information control factor, which is the modern problem.

The public has greater access to information now than at basically any other time in human history. It seems completely backwards to suggest that 'information control is a modern problem'.

>I was explaining how money is not equitable to your value and how it's exploited, not that """"""money is a bad idea"""""".

No, it is a statement of a fact. You have one coconut. The only reason why nobody bigger than you can come and take it from you is that enough people sat together and decided that won't do. You can *own* something , but unless that ownership is aknowledged by the people around you it is meaningless as soon as someone else wants what you have.

>If I mow your lawn without me and you coming to an agreement, can I take from your paycheck? You benefited.

Was this lawnmowing decided by an elected member of my governament following the agreed policies and laws? No? Was it just a random guy walking on my lawn on its own you say?

>6/10 people decided to vote to take all of Bob's things and Bob voted against. He could NOT change that via voting.

6/10 of people decided that's the share everyone should chip in, in correspondence to their means. If the situation is so abhorring, I'm sure he'll have no trouble finding allies in his crusade.

Not claiming that they match the state of things. I'm trying to show you that you don't really believe that ""you can leave"" is sufficient. In the mob example, a rational person would CHOOSE to go there, and a rational person would consider it theft. 

You also don't believe that benefiting from something is reason enough to be demanded payment for it, as you can see with the lawn mowing. (since you brought them up and how they differ: home owners associations have a legitimate claim to ownership and therefore authority, states do not.)

Now you bring up ""the agreement was made by society"", which is the democracy argument, but I'm sure you don't really believe that something that is democratically decided makes it right.

You don't have any actual facts to base your opinion on. Either read what I'm writing and acknowledge that I as an individual (no ""sock puppets"") am capable of coherently denying the assertions you make, or shut up and go back to /r/LateStageCapitalism to circle jerk with others that think the same as you. 

""I think maybe what is going on in this thread is calling bullshit on literally anyone using the Flint tragedy to showcase their charitable deeds... Is Elon not rich enough to navigate a donation like this without taking credit for it? Is it required that this be made known publicly? No. He's doing it for public relation reasons...""

You assume based purely off of your own intuition that the intent behind Elon's actions are to make himself look good. There is no proof of this in the article. Your only ""evidence"" is that he did not remain anonymous. This is a standard which you could only possibly hold for someone whom you do not want to receive positive public recognition. 

""I guarantee you it is possible to make a charitable donation without anyone knowing it came from you. Of course Elon did not make this announcement himself, all he had to do was make it known to them... They do the rest. ""

Again you assume Elon's thoughts and intentions, while claiming I'm putting words in your mouth, with no evidence to back it up other than 'he's rich and he COULD have been anonymous'. This is a ridiculous standard to hold somebody to simply because they are wealthy and exist in the public eye.

""Last comment to you bc you seem willfully ignorant at this point.... you inquired why people are not impressed by this."" 

Funny, I never asked that. It must be tough when I'm putting so many words in your mouth. 

""It's probably because Elon made this donation knowing full well his name would appear in the news in a positive light being the new Flint Hero. He needs positive PR right now, and he's using Flint to serve that need. People who are mindful typically don't like that kind of charitable deed, bc it isn't about the charity involved, it's about the credit.""

Once again, you're assuming Elon's intent and you also manage to insinuate that you're different (cough cough better) than other people because you're ""mindful"". Me saying ""People who are pragmatic typically like any kind of charitable deed, because it isn't about the credit involved, it's about the charity"" is equally as presumptuous and based on anecdotal evidence as yours. 

""They need laptops? Elon could have donated them anonymously. He chose not to bc he wants the cred.""

Once again assuming intent and stating that your OPINION is that he did it all for credit.

You quite literally say that the only manner in which you would have accepted Musk's donation as legitimate charity is if it were completely anonymous.

If it were completely anonymous you would know nothing about it and would continue to have a negative perception (that you seem hell bent on maintaining) of Musk.

Either way you'd hate him, and it's at that point where you need to ask if he's worth it.

He's an ridiculously rich nerd who's trying to develop his passion projects to be commercially viable. Sure he says some shitty things and makes mistakes, but vilifying him for MAYBE trying to better his image is absurd. 

I noticed that you seem to be a fan of the sub /r/latestagecapitalism

You must be able to recognize that the guy who wants to push many fields of engineering past where they would have gone otherwise is not the same as the billionaires actively oppressing the lower socioeconomic classes. 

It's funny, I'm not even a huge fan of Elon Musk as a human being but you're blindly hating on a man because he might have had alternative motives while donating almost half a million dollars to children dealing with a situation that shouldn't exist in our country. 

I get that it goes against what LSC has been telling you, but sometimes rich people do want to help people. Unless the Gates, Warren Buffet, Soros, Zuckerberg, and Bloomberg are all just desparate for some really good PR.

At the end of the day you're trying to argue Musk doesn't deserve news coverage for his donation. Maybe argue that the media outlets need to be more selective about what they determine to be news, rather than claim without proof Musk was relying on a second hand source to get the news out and that he's the one responsible for this appearing in the media.

A big driver of that is depreciation expense which is the basis in the building/improvements spread over ~39-50 years on commercial buildings since the business can’t deduct a $5M building in a single year under current law. However, when companies/individuals sell business property, all of that benefit they received in the form of depreciation expense becomes ordinary income instead of getting capital treatment as long as the gain on sale is greater than basis - depreciation taken or allowable. It’s more or less a loan and a gamble on tax rates.

Moreover, you get some of the same deductions for owning property because you deduct property taxes/mortgage interest if you have enough deductions to itemize when combined with other itemized deductions (>24K for MFJ, >18K for heads of household, and >12K for everyone left over). 

So let’s say you’re in the 22% marginal rate bracket and you buy a house in 2019 and pay interest to the tune of $10K and property taxes the same on it and file single. That means the after tax cost of owning your home (excl. principal payments and repairs/improvements/insurance) is going to be (20K)*(1-.22) + those other three costs. 

What I’m getting at, for the most part, is that you get some of the exact same benefits, and if you owned real estate for rental purposes, would get the full suite of business.

Now, pay for a road to that house, pay to have plumbing and electricity ran, pay for a guard to patrol the surrounding area, pay to have someone come out and teach your kids while you're out working, pay to make sure the factory a few miles away isn't dumping garbage into your property, pay to have your own garbage removed.

That would be by far the most direct taxation because it happens at the point of transaction. And if you are worried about progressive tax structures and people avoiding it, there are two solutions: one, have graduated tax structures based on the pricing of the item and classifications of items according to their degree of luxury, and impose import duties on people bringing items into the country during customs checks if they cannot provide proof-of-purchase inside the US for certain items (cars, boats, expensive electronics, jewelry, whatever). And of course graduated property taxes. 

But again, revenue is a sledgehammer solution and you've failed to address the problem I've raised, instead just avoiding it. You are raising a problem but failing to explain why your solution is a good solution, or how you address the very obvious problem it creates: namely it's a huge penalty to companies that are run honestly without the resources to hire expensive accountants to do offshore tax havens and who sometimes run at a loss: i.e. small businesses. It also ignores the fact that yes, sometimes even *large* businesses legitimately operate at a loss. Otherwise said business would never go *out of* business, which is of course not factually accurate. 

In the case of GE, they suffered *huge* and very real losses because of the financial crisis and their financial division. Now those losses were deserved, but taxing those losses further doesn't make a ton of sense. 

And of course if you tax revenue, ultimately you are just passing said cost on to consumers because companies will absolutely *have* to recoup those costs to stay solvent if they aren't hugely profitable and demand is inelastic, and even *if* demand is elastic but all other corporations they compete with bare the same cost, meaning said cost will already be baked into the price. In short, you aren't even doing what you *want*, which is to tax the rich. You are just taxing consumers in a convoluted way.

The state has no rightful claim to your property.
Nor have you, or anyone else because there is no such thing. Our laws are arbitrary and they are in place because they work enough for the system not to collapse and even to prosper. The only reason why our roads are not bumper car rides is that we agreed red means stop and green means go. There is no moral reason why it shouldn't work the other way around.

Individuals have morals and they take decisons based on them. Large groups such as, say, the US governament, have guidelines - which may have been created on a moral basis - and they are kept together by people seeking whatever they consider their own benefit and who, for most part, consider the existence of the state a net plus. They might be wrong about that, but that's another story.

Note: ""their own benefit"" might include, say, being able to nurture the common good or to follow their own moral code. It doesn't have to mean ""they are free to be egoistic"", although they certainly can do that as well.

We have spent millennia discussing of what is morally right but I am quite confident that no amount of debate would get a hundred people to come into complete agreement, let alone a country or the world.


>moral justifications

None of my arguments are moral in nature.
Bob decides wether he benefits more from the lawnmowing or from keeping his fifteen bucks and he can take this decision because the state prevents others from imposing any unwanted lawnmowning on him. The system stands because more people enjoy having the ability to decide how to employ their money than surprise lawnmowing.
My argument is not ""this is right"" but ""this is rent, not theft"". You are free to find it as morally repulsive as you wish. You'll find plenty of people consider renting immoral as well.

>A rational person would move to the city, and a reasonable person would call that 'tax' theft. ""You can leave"" is clearly not sufficient.

So, if I get that correctly your argument to prove that taxation is theft is just comparing taxation to theft and calling it a day?
A more sensible example would be:

""You are offered to move into a city that requires you to pay a monthly fee of 30% of your earnings in exchange for a number of services. Everyone pays the fee and officers who handle the money it produces are answerable to the law.

Not to mention the systematic alienation of minorities as well as the atrocities committed in South America, Asia, and Africa to support the capitalists and their “free market.”  Unlike true socialism, capitalism is, by nature, a violent and exploitative system that causes suffering for everyone besides the capitalists. I imagine, as I cannot say for sure, that you were lucky enough to be born into a country that is on the top of the capitalist food chain, so it might be hard to see the reality of this system, but I assure you that if you truly look, you will see that violence, suppression, and exploitation are the true fruits of capitalism and always have been.

I'm sorry if you don't feel like I explained my solution clearly. Instead of taxing the money where it ends up (bank accounts, Panama, Cayman islands, wherever), and trying to play games to make sure that money gets taxed properly, why not tax it when the companies receive the money? Get it at the source. 

I'm not saying increase the tax rate. I don't understand why people are thinking that this will somehow cause more businesses to go under. It will make them tax a percentage of their revenue instead of their profit. Different percentages, because those are very different numbers, but the effective tax rate would be the same. If anything, this will make tax rates much more predictable. We can have a low revenue tax rate, instead of a tax on the profit. That way your paid tax is a much more predictable expense, instead of a percentage of whatever profit you have at the end of a quarter.

Business that are following the rules will probably be paying around the same tax rate, assuming they have consistent revenue and profits, like grocery stores. But the businesses that hide their revenue in BS expenses won't be able to pretend they didn't make that revenue. We have the receipts (well, the IRS does). 

\>  And of course if you tax revenue, ultimately you are just passing said cost on to consumers 

This is a weak argument. By this logic it's impossible to ever justify any tax increase. Which is also not what I'm proposing.

I agree. If there was such a thing as rightful ownership, the state would not have it.

>Nor have you, or anyone else because there is no such thing.

I would say it's a complicated subject, many ideologies can consistently claim rightful ownership, as in they don't make contradictions within themselves about that ownership. E.g. - many think the state DOES have rightful ownership, but also think Bob killing someone and claiming all the land they lived on as his own then imposing himself on the rest is wrong (basically how most states are formed). I don't have much of a problem with how someone defines ownership as long as they don't contradict themselves.

>We have spent millennia discussing of what is morally right but I am quite confident that no amount of debate would get a hundred people to come into complete agreement, let alone a country or the world.

Well, their are certain ideologies that say ""then don't"". However, just because one thinks/knows taxes are theft does not mean they believe there should be no taxes or rules or w/e. They just think that it should change what you use taxes for. You should think ""would it be ok for me to rob someone to pay for x?"". If not, taxes for it are probably wrong.

>None of my arguments are moral in nature.

""Is 'x' theft?"" is a moral question isn't it? If you argue that objective morality doesn't exist, which I think is not necessarily wrong, or that ownership isn't really a thing, then how could theft ever be a thing? I don't think it could, but I bet you still call the guy in the alley with a gun taking people's money a thief. I assume that would be your subjective morality saying that, but I'm saying 99% of people's subjective morality should also call taxes theft if they actually think through it.

> A more sensible example would be:

You mistake what I'm doing. Many people's justification for taxes NOT being theft is that ""you can leave, therefore you choose to stay, anything that you opt in to is not theft"". I am simply showing you/whoever holds that argument that you don't REALLY believe that. People choose to live somewhere that benefits them the most, hurts them the least, not because they agree with the rules of whoever is holding the gun.

Your example is democracy + ability to leave + 'beneficial services' (beneficial is subjective, but I assume you consider healthcare to be beneficial).

Suppose the country - United Federation - has 'authority' over 95% of the earth. You could leave their rule but the other 5% is basically a big war zone. 51% of the country vote to have 95% tax on income to provide top tier healthcare, that's all the money goes to. The 51% who voted for it are financially independent (especially with the free healthcare now) and no longer have a need to work. Is the United Federation stealing from its people in your view? I'm not asking you if this example closely models the state you live in, I'm trying to see if you apply your criteria fairly. I'm sure you view healthcare as beneficial (do taxes have to be efficient in your view to not be theft?), the 49% have 'the ability to leave' (never would, keeping 5% of income is better than moving to a war zone), and the decision was made democratically.

If a state with monarchy had all the same taxes and tax funded programs as their democratic neighbor (say the state you live in) by coincidence (the king does not actively copy what they vote on, it just happens that they have the same tax levels and programs), would you consider those taxes theft since they don't have your ""democracy"" requirement? Do you consider all tax funded programs that you do not view as ""beneficial"" to be theft?

I don't intend to be giving a ""gotcha"" vibe or w/e, I'm genuinely curious how you would view these situations within your subjective moral code.

>Someone claiming that might makes right has exactly as much evidence to back up his statement as someone who preaches natural rights.

Nonono, that's not how it works. If you can get by on less money than you earn, you are morally obligated to give up the money you don't need. Whether there is a need for it or not is irrelevant, the reality is you could be living on less. It's the moral thing to do.

You know what, forget the $100,000 job. Even right now, you could be living on less. I think you should give me half of your money right now. I'll use it to buy all of the homeless people in my town some lobster tails. So please, give me your bank account information. Thank you. 

>a tax on people who literally can't spend the massive amount of money they have is a punishment.

I had no idea there was a limit to how successful someone is allowed to be.

""Remember kids, if you work hard in life, at some point your achievements will stop mattering."" 

Oh, and you didn't answer my question. How much of a billionaire's money do you think other people are entitled to? If someone has so much money that they can't even spend it, how much of that money does someone else deserve? 

>We should probably teach children that instead of having billionaires who hoard wealth, we could like actually solve issues like homelessness, poverty and hunger. That should be the metric for a successful society not having a handful of people who have all of the money

You're right! It's so simple! Just take the money of the wealthy, and give it to the poor! It'll never fail! 

There was that one country that succeeded in solving issues like homelessness, poverty, and hunger by redistributing people's wealth. I mean, so many of them succeeded, but there was that one country that really succeeded. It should be the metric of a successful society. Did it start with an S? No, that was the Soviet Union. People were still happy there though right? 

Did it start with a V? Wait, that's Venezuela. Aren't people leaving Venezuela? No, that doesn't make sense. Why would anyone leave a country that tried to solve issues like poverty and hunger? 

Did it start with a C? No, that's China. All of their citizens were well-fed right?

Hang on, every time a country tried to solve issues like homelessness, poverty, and hunger by redistributing people's wealth, they all fucking failed! 

It's been fun arguing with another one of the intellectual geniuses from ChapoTrapHouse, but I have things to do so I'm going to wrap this up:

Your ideology is a failure. It failed 50 years ago. It failed 30 years ago. It's failing right now as we speak. It will fail 10 years from now. It will fail 100 years from now. Do you know why it keeps failing and will continue to fail? Because people are not entitled to the wealth of others. You did not earn it, you do not deserve it. If you worked for someone who has that money, you are entitled to whatever amount you consented upon when you agreed to work for them. 

And for the record, I do think people should pay taxes, but not to the extent that they lose half of their earnings. Why should a billionaire lose half of his earnings while you only lose 10%? Because he's wealthier than you? Do you know why he has that money? Because he earned it. You did not. 

Anyways, I'm not replying anymore. **HOWEVER,** I am still expecting your bank account information. If your next reply to me doesn't contain your bank account info, then I will reply, and I'll probably keep replying for quite some time until you give it to me.

>that should be paid for with the money of those who would have hundreds of millions of dollars even if literally 99% of their wealth were taken

No, it should be paid by everyone who has money that they don't need. You don't get to be exempt just because you're not loaded. Every penny you have that you don't spend is money that could be saving starving people. Don't be selfish.

>okay, if ""hard work"" is the determining factor in whether one is homeless or a multi-billionaire, we're in agreement on a 100% estate tax, yeah?

No, because an estate tax also punishes hard work. It punishes the parents and grandparents who worked hard so that their offspring could get by in life.

Greatest cruelty ever? No. Taking away the majority of their money that they earned? Yes, that is cruel. 

>had that money gone to nasa we'd have a moonbase and the same employees would have better pay and decent benefits but sure: thanks, mr. billionaire

It's not your place to tell people how to spend their money. If they want to be selfish, that is their right. Also, Musk has done more for people than you ever have or will ever do so I really don't think you should be playing the selfish card. But hey, as soon as you give me your bank account information, then you can start talking about selfish billionaires.

Lol. At least you managed to make me laugh. 

>the situation you're describing can not and will never be allowed under capitalism -- at least not for long

And the situation you want in which wealth is redistributed to solve other people's problems can not and will never succeed. Wanna know how I know? Because it's been tried before, countless times. And it always fails. Always. I'll take not for long over guaranteed to fail any day. 

>this is as close to that kind of job market as i've ever seen it (which incidentally sure feels like it's about to end) and yet we aren't seeing wages rise drastically, or a big uptick in union certification/membership, or any other sign you might expect to see from a workforce with the most leverage it's had in years

>why is that? could it be that workers fear retribution? could it be that their options aren't really as wide-open as your lolbertarian dogma suggests? weird, huh?

And I'll still take all that over your socialist ""paradise."" I'm sure many people who don't want to go from decently fed to guaranteed starvation will take it also.

Plenty of people get lucky. Zuckerberg got lucky with Facebook, Steve Jobs kind of got lucky with investors for Apple. Hell, Elon Musk likely got lucky with his first company. But I'm pretty sure what allowed his major companies to survive was his extremely hard work, his ideas, his ability to make things happen, and his money. 

Sure, you could say he got lucky he has good PR skills, lucky that he was raised in a certain environment that made him the way he is, lucky that his genes helped make him smart, lucky that someone decided to give him money for his ideas, but in that case you'd just attribute everything he has accomplished to luck, and not to him, which contradicts your view that neither luck nor hard work nor talent were exclusively responsible for his success. 

I guess you could say his companies thrived mostly because of his ideas, which he can't control, but his ideas are far from astonishing or unheard of. He just makes them happen while others don't. 

You could say that he got lucky because if his first company hadn't succeeded, his companies wouldn't exist now. But that's only an assumption. You can't actually know that. He might have been able to get the money some other way. 

You could say that he got lucky because he got funding from the government, else his companies would have never gotten off the ground, but that only happened because someone decided that his ideas were worthy of the money and because they believed in Elon Musk to make good of his promises. I don't think you can attribute that to luck. 

Basically, I'm saying you can't get lucky for having been born in a way, or being raised in a certain environment, that allows you to succeed in life, because that would mean everything one has accomplished isn't actually his doing, but can rather be attributed to such things that I said previously.

>. By this logic it's impossible to ever justify any tax increase. 

No. By that logic any *generalized* corporate tax will be inefficient and will be passed on to the consumer. That's just factually true. It's not some hypothetical. It's why most economists disagree with corporate tax and prefer graduated income tax. Corporate taxes are just regressive consumption taxes in actual practice. You can imagine that's not the case but it's how it plays out in reality. Corporate taxes are baked into the cost of goods and services outside of a small set of cases where doing so would make the company non competitive with other competitors in the space, which with generalized revenue taxes would pretty much never be the case unless you maybe implemented some sort of progressive revenue tax structures that penalized larger companies.

Even that though you'd have to ask does that actually make any sense? Why should a company being large result in it being penalized? 

The issue you really have is *individuals* getting super wealthy. You are trying to address that in a super indirect way that doesn't even fundamentally solve the problem. Historically progressive income tax structures worked very well. There is little reason that couldn't be the case again.

The workers. You ever been part of a restaurant opening? Ever seen what happens to everyone who was part of it when a new restaurant goes out of business?

> Who took the risk of losing it all?

Definitely the workers. The guy whose only job description is ""owning things"" won't be the one getting evicted by yet another person whose only job is owning things when that restaurant goes under. If this was a fair system, then that wouldn't be a problem anyway because our great friend the owner could just go back to being a worker until he can own enough things to try again. 

> And who should gain from that risk?

I'm going to have to go with the workers once again. It was their labor that created the restaurant, it was their warmth that fostered lasting relationships with the customers, and it was their commitment to excellence that determined whether the enterprise would rise or fall.

Yeah, I just don't see any use for the owners in a business. They just mooch off the hard work of others. ",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec7jzcs,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec7jzcs/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

if there were such scarcity that all our combined material wealth were not enough to cover everyone's needs, but i don't think that's the case and i don't think it's been the case for a long while

we've reached a point where the extremely rich are accumulating money faster than they're able to spend it -- supposedly faster than they can even *give it away*, in bill gates' case, allegedly -- so what difference is it if they keep it or not? past a billion dollars, that kind of personal wealth becomes essentially fucking *theoretical*

>No, because an estate tax also punishes hard work. It punishes the parents and grandparents who worked hard so that their offspring could get by in life. 

thus is created a class of people sustained for generations not by their work or innovation but by the circumstance of their birth

also, working harder hasn't meant more money for a while now -- again, average productivity has continued ever-upward while wages have stagnated

y'know what discourages me from wanting to put any effort into working harder? knowing that every additional penny i make for my employer is going to wind up in the doughy hands of [some investor's idiot grandson](https://youtu.be/QEw0Whi73C0)

point is, no single person should have unilateral *control* over that kind of wealth, let alone *ownership*, and i think taxing the very rich is a helluva lot less cruel than the shit we're currently doing to the poor

>It's not your place to tell people how to spend their money.

it was probably mid-2009 or 2010 that the juvenile illusion of a basically stable world -- managed by people who mostly know what they're doing and who are essentially rational -- was shattered for me as everything went to shit at the worst possible time for me and my family

I'm taking the position that this doesn't matter. It's not an invalid point, but it's a bad argument. Every kind of corporate tax we implement will effect prices. It's a built in negative. I don't see the value in discussing it. 

> Why should a company being large result in it being penalized?

Taxes aren't penalties. We tax what we need to. Not out of spite. But for the same reason a progressive tax rate is effective when taxing individuals, we should tax bigger companies more and smaller companies less.

Look at progressive tax rates this way: if you barely make enough money to live each year, we will tax you the lowest amount we can. But once you start making money past that minimum amount to live, we'll tax that at a slightly higher rate, because you can afford it, and we need to tax this money more, because we taxed the first $10k at a lower rate.

This keeps going up when you make more money. Millionaires experience the same tax rate as poor people for the first, like $9k I think. They've changed it recently. But each range of income indicates additional, *extra* money. It's not money required to live. (Note: we can argue over the exact amounts. For example, I think the tax rate for the first couple of income brackets should be much lower, and the brackets widened. And I think the tax rate of people that make over 100k per year should go up)

Same with a revenue tax. Tax the amount of revenue after $xxxk amount of dollars per year, or something. The exact amounts don't matter with my example. But as the company makes more and more revenue, they'll pay higher and higher taxes.

> The issue you really have is individuals getting super wealthy

Thanks for telling me what I believe, but I'm capable of hating how much money corporations and individuals make. Tax big corporations and tax the rich. Heavily. 

> Not all states have income tax, Oregon for example, and there is no federal income tax. And in so far as we have sales tax, it's generally not implemented in the way I suggested.

This feels like whataboutism. I live in Washington. We have no income tax. We have an incredible high sales tax. This more significantly effects the poor. I make a healthy amount of money per year, so it doesn't affect me that much. I would rather have income tax, because I know I can handle the burden better than the poor. Also, lower sales tax will increase local sales. There's pros and cons to both types.

>something like 40-50 million americans already need help getting enough food to survive (be it charitable or governmental) -- in the wealthiest country on earth, in allegedly ""good times"" economically, and while wealth continues to accumulate only at very top

And that's a hell of a lot better than 300,000,000 Americans starving, which is what you're ideology would do.

>what happens when we hit another recession? what happens when this useless fucking government does nothing to act and we spiral into depression?

We recover from it, just like we did the last few times.

>lol wait, are you giving me all this shit while holding a public-fucking-sector job?

>oh god are you giving me all this shit while paying union dues?

Never said Unions were bad. Workers do have the right to argue for better working conditions and pay. They just don't get to force their employers, or fellow employees, into doing whatever they want. If workers want to protest, let them. If the employer's business really depends on them, they'll make the workers happy. If not, tough shit for the workers, they're entitled to nothing. 

>it was probably mid-2009 or 2010 that the juvenile illusion of a basically stable world -- managed by people who mostly know what they're doing and who are essentially rational -- was shattered for me as everything went to shit at the worst possible time for me and my family

So you gave up a juvenile illusion for an even more juvenile illusion. Got it.

You know, at this point I would ask you for your bank account info again to show you just how feeble your ideology is, but you genuinely don't seem like a bad person. Though your beliefs are misguided, I can at least respect someone who wants to do good. This argument seems to be going nowhere so I think I'm done replying. Hope things work out for you.

But for the same reason a progressive tax rate is effective when taxing individuals, we should tax bigger companies more and smaller companies less.

Yes. That's true for *individuals*. The reason is simple. *Individuals* hold wealth for personal use. That same logic is *not* true for corporations, for which income is used for one of two purposes; reinvestment in the company (productive) or towards shareholders (personal wealth). The later generally only happens when companies make a profit. Therefore if your goal is to tax *wealth*, the place to do it is at the point of profit *not* revenue which is directed towards things like payroll. 

>Look at progressive tax rates this way: if you barely make enough money to live each year, we will tax you the lowest amount we can. But once you start making money past that minimum amount to live, we'll tax that at a slightly higher rate, because you can afford it, and we need to tax this money more, because we taxed the first $10k at a lower rate.

I don't need a lecture on progressive tax structure. I've literally advocated for it several times during our discussion. Obviously I know what it is. I *prefer* it. 

>But as the company makes more and more revenue, they'll pay higher and higher taxes.

But the company making revenue is *not* the same as a person making *income*. These are two totally non-analogous things. Revenue is not income until someone actually has the money in hand to spend for themselves. Corporate revenue by contrast is only allocated

The bottom line is that a corporation is just a collective enterprise of people. Many people of all incomes depend on that corporation for jobs. A graduated tax structure for *corporate revenue* is a collective tax that filters down to *all* employees in ways completely decided by the company. The progressive tax structure is immediately lost at the point of payroll. You didn't actually accomplish anything in terms of wealth redistribution, which is the entire point of a progressive tax structure! Rather you just delegated that decision making to the corporation. They have a new cost and they have to figure out how to allocate it. That may or may not go to highest earners. But it could just as easily be *re*gressive through wage suppression and layoffs. Is that a win? I sure don't think so. 

>Thanks for telling me what I believe, but I'm capable of hating how much money corporations and individuals make. Tax big corporations and tax the rich. Heavily.

But *why* do you think it is a problem for a *corporation* to have money ultimately? That is, do you hate a corporation with 50,000 employees and $1 billion in revenue that pays each and every employee the same salary just as much as a company with 50,000 employees and $1 billion in revenue where the CEO is paid 250 times as much as the janitor? Because you are treating these two companies exactly the same. Is that fair? Is that accomplishing whatever your goal is, presumably a fairer distribution of actual *wealth* and not just capital? 

>This feels like whataboutism.

That's not what [whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism) is dude. If you insist on trying to claim it's a fallacy, it would be ""cherry-picking,"" but that isn't really the case here because it's a question of whether the solution you claimed was ""already in place"" actually was in the sense I suggested. It is not. This was one of multiple reasons. Ergo it doesn't really address my point about why I think it would be good to have a *progressive* sales tax. We do not have that in the US. We have a hodgepodge system of state sales taxes constructed in wildly different ways, most being fundamentally *regressive*. You can't claim we already have the system I suggested when in actual practice it's nothing like what I suggested.

Did you both voluntarily agree to that deal? Does the person providing the service own that business (you can't sell something that isn't yours for example)?

>should I say that hypothetically someone taking my money could be theft, therefore I shouldn't pay for the service?

If you both agree to it and it is theirs to provide, then no it's not theft if they take your money.

First example might work on a very small scale, but would fail upon any sort of upscaling because it defies many of the basic rules of capitalist economics. If every employee is a member with equal share of the profit, then the company is cut off from one of the most common means of increasing profit, cutting wages. If the company cannot cut wages, then the only way to increase profit is to either raise prices, which will lead to smaller market share and decrease any chances of outside investment, or out source the work to a different company. At that point, the company would just be pushing the exploitation of labor onto some other firm. In any case, a harsher and more competitive firm will eventually come along and offer the capitalists a higher yield on their investment and put the first firm out of business. There is no way to keep capital inside a socially-minded firm because the motivation for capital is to grow and socialism is antithesis of growth.  

As for your second idea, communes are of course socialist.  They are “communist” by name and nature! But they do not work on a large scale because of their inability to compete with capitalist ventures. The most they can hope for is to manage to keep a low profile and remove themselves as much as possible from the system that surrounds them. That is not a socialist revolution, that is escapism. It’s fine for the rich white dude who can just up and leave whenever he wants, but what about the kids living in the city who has to juggle school and work to take care of his family? What about the kids who work for slave wages in Asia just to keep a bit food in there stomachs? What about the single mom with tens of thousands in student loans working 3 jobs to pay the rent? Communes are limited in scope and in practical solutions for most people. 

Third example is family farms... this is just outdated. We all know that the food industry is actively and intentionally pushing these into extinction because they are unable to compete with modern mass-farming technology. There is no case to be made that family farms are somehow the answer to capitalism’s woes, not by a long shot. 

As I said, I will watch the video and hopefully it will shed some light on these ideas that I have missed... ",news,t2_kauvf,a7yjzk,ec8cd2j,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/ec8cd2j/,/r/news/comments/a7yjzk/elon_musk_provides_423k_to_buy_laptops_for_all/

It's a little boring and exhausting, it's 12 hours of hard labor 2-3 days in a row. I wouldn't exactly call it meaningless, since physical labor does function as exercise. I certainly wound not want to do 12 hours of a sedentary job; but it beats 5 8s or 4 10s. Also I get depressed if I don't work for more than 4 days in a row. My biggest problem with it is that the job is too tiring to do more than 3 days in a row so i can only get 4 hours of overtime without sacrificing my health, I am looking to get cross-trained into an easier department so that I have the option of coming in on my days off and save more money for a house and retirement fund. Of course I never intend on fully retiring because I would not enjoy a life without working at least a day a week. Also, my work has meaning in that it relieves me of worry from starving and provides the funds I use for my hobbies, which involve consumer goods(video games and miniatures) which, incidentally,  would likely not exist in a socialist world

>What about those people who used to mill the cheese? Where are they? Likely downsized for the sake of cutting costs and maximizing profits.

Nah, our company has been crowing since the 90s, grew explosively in the last 8 years and is only now starting to taper off on the cheese manufacturing. We succeed because we market as a gourmet cheese and other companies can't make a profit without compromising quality, so we market to restaurants and they market to consumers. Whey is getting to be our big seller. My job is very secure because even if we can't sell the cheese, we still make money off the whey that's produced by the cheddaring process. People don't last long at my particular job because the physical demands don't appeal to everyone; but they just transfer out. Our company gives priority to associates for transfer over simply hiring new people. The only people I know who got fired were from destruction of property. I actually know someone who got offered a lateral promotion because they were bad at their current job(couldn't cut it as a plant manager, so they made him in charge of safety training).

To affect that kind of change, I would not only have to participate in a violent revolution in this country; I would have to support war and ideological genocide in nearly EVERY country. Do you seriously believe no little Asian kids are going to be collateral damage in that kind of conflict? Or even that no kids died in the Bolshevik revolution?

Italics mine for emphasis. This is entirely irrelevant language if your point is not that a capitalist country that doesn’t have to deal with these problems is unrelated to another capitalist country that does. Your argument is  a manipulative guilt-based rhetoric, and it leads to these kinds tangents because the rhetoric is based on a faulty assumption.

Here is my counter point then; people in this country do not have to deal with that violence. Therefore the violence you perceive is not inherent to capitalism and is caused by some other factors.

> So you are saying you are obsolete at your job? 

> You obviously work a typical depressing job that over-works and under-pays you

Here’s another inconsistency in your argument. If I’m obsolete than my boss is overpaying me. In that case I would be the one stealing from my boss, right? Or who am I stealing from?

> But you have convinced yourself that over working yourself (instead of maybe perusing self improvement, art, education, etc.) is what keeps you from depression. 

Mmhmm. Funny how you ignored the part where I pointed out that capitalism gives me funds for an artistic hobby that likely would not even exist without capitalism(miniatures, I actually have tried pursuing painting on canvas but I found it lacks the structure necessary to see improvement in skills, I do know several other artists that worked in the same company and my brother is a writer). And that not working at least a day out of the week makes me feel depressed. And that my job involves self improvement(voluntary strenuous activity). And that I want to work more hours. But when your argument is based on unrealistic rhetoric that’s what you have to do, you have to only accept information that fits your bias.

> I’ve already made my case. I’m not taking about just this country, I’m taking about capitalism as a whole. You have chosen not to see and to ignore the evidence. I am tired of explaining violence and all the forms it can take

Your exhaustion is a form of cognitive dissonance. If capitalism as a whole was to blame for violence, you wouldn’t need to point out what happens in countries I don’t bring up, because you’d have examples of it here.

 >ready to truly question the world you live in, let me know. 

Yeah, you picked the wrong guy to bust that line out on. I was raised in a fundamentalist cult and have had the experience of completely questioning the worldview I lived in at great personal cost. That’s why I can see inconsistencies you are completely ignoring in emotion based rhetoric, and observing the effects of the cognitive dissonance it causes, because I had to sort through those already. I don’t feel the effects of exhaustion from explaining my worldview. It actually energizes me and keeps me from getting into destructive automatic negative thoughts I’ve experienced from the trauma that religion caused.

unemployment is at a low because people who have *given up* on being able to find work aren't counted in unemployment rates. also, there are people who *can't* work either because of disability or being required to stay at home to be a caretaker.

It's pretending an owner has 0 risk, and doesn't stand to lose anything. 

And pretending that an owner is just there to own and look pretty.

That is some of the most ignorant bullshit I have ever read.

Ignoring that an owner/operator of a small business likely had to take out loans to start up a business.

That's the stuff that causes bankruptcy on failure. To pretend that a hired hand stands more to lose is laughable.

Most businesses in America are small business, with a failure rate of >50%.

If you really buy into it that a worker stands more to lose, then feel free to take out a loan and start a business.

Did we read the same comment? The one I read said none of those things. Just that workers take more risk and that the business can't exist without workers. 

And again nobody is saying the person starting the venture is taking *no* risk just that if things go south they are much much more likely to be in a better position to handle it.

Of course  Hawking is a scientist, but  in a field that has nothing to do with AI  (cosmology). He sadly joins the ranks of many scientists who because they are legitimately an expert in one field, think they have expertise or insight into another field. 

And Musk isn't even a scientist.


So this award smacks of two people in a bubble patting each other on the back. Worse they gave a very distorted perspective of AI.  The trouble in the immediate future won't be Skynet,  but rather an AI denying minorities loans because it was trained on biased input data.

The launch of Starman in Elon's Tesla Roadster on top of the first flight of the Falcon Heavy had a huge affect on many people. 

I know this, because I run a website very much related to this, http://www.whereisroadster.com . For the first month or so after the launch I was CONSTANTLY receiving emails from people who were touched by this very human display, many of which expressed an interest in going in to science and engineering as a result. And let's face it, I didn't do a lot, just put a website together, but the fact that people were willing to email me about their stories, well, that says something!

I know that Elon Musk isn't the best communicator, and he does a lot of crazy stuff, but he has done something that some of the best scientists and engineers have failed to do over the last 30 years, get people excited about space exploration. Many people have tried, but Elon has succeeded.
