I had heard two different pieces on NPR. They spoke with injured workers on both shows and on one they interviewed a physician’s assistant who left because she raised concerns. She said injured workers, some who couldn’t even walk, were taken to a hospital by Uber so that the company could avoid using an ambulance, which they would need to report as an accident. NPR played back numerous calls recorded by 9-11 operators. Apparently calls are made frequently, every week. I don’t recall the exact numbers, but I believe it was more than once a week.

Then there is Musk & his fucking ridiculous hate-on for the colour yellow. In places like an auto manufacturing plant, zones where a worker could get hurt by moving machinery have to be indicated and yellow is the universal caution colour. These places will have, amongst other things, lines painted yellow on the floor as an indication of where not to walk. But Musk banned the use of the colour yellow. Fuck safety for the employees who help you maintain your wealth, right Elon? As far as I’m considered, he’s elitist scum.

Also consider that humans began domesticating dogs around 10,000 years ago, and wolves and dogs split over 30,000 years ago. Have they changed a lot since then? By appearances, yes. Then again, so have humans (by appearances), but that has really not translated directly to intelligence gains for either species.

For dogs, humans have interfered and encouraged a few specific traits, some of which *seem* to indicate higher degrees of intelligence than others. However, that’s not necessarily true. That observation might say more about what we value than about the actual mental capabilities of the animal.

More generally, I would posit that intelligence is not a spectrum at all, really, but more like a multidimensional set of abilities that allow creatures to process information and use it for survival. You can think of brains as consisting of specific modules that provide certain kinds of functionality.

What makes us “more” intelligent than some other species is not that we moved along some sliding scale over time, but that our brain consists of several types of modules, of which many other animals have a smaller subset. This gives us a lot more to work with. But the kind of evolution that could provide those features to dogs would require a lot of time, probably more than the total lifetime of our own species, which is, so far, (at most) around 200,000-300,000 years.",news,t2_c8tda,bo1csj,enbi336,/r/news/comments/bo1csj/elon_musk_to_receive_2019_stephen_hawking_medal/enbi336/,/r/news/comments/bo1csj/elon_musk_to_receive_2019_stephen_hawking_medal/

51,Nicholas-DM,https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-spacex-ceo-elon-musk-receives-stephen-hawking-medal/,"Say you have car A and car B.

Car A and Car B take roughly the same amount of energy to build, sourced from parts all over the world, as all car manufacturing is done these days.

Car A, after being built, continues to burn fuel into even more noxious gases into the atmosphere, which must be trucked from around the world, processed, then trucked in to stations for Car A to use.

Car B, after being built, takes in electricity created by power plants near its point of charging. These power plants just so happen to be insanely more efficient than the engine in Car A. As these power plants become more renewable, the energy is more and more effective.

Regular car parts are sourced from around the world. Teslas have more car parts built in the U.S. than the majority of automakers-- partially due to the fact that they are still a smaller carmaker, not having massive production. Their batteries are produced by them and Panasonic in a joint venture, at a giant factory in the U.S. They provide more American jobs per car. They're more environmentally sound, incredibly safe-- and, more importantly, have jumped started the industry moving to electric cars, which are proven to be better for the environment.

There is some bad. Elon has made some serious missteps, such as the Thai Diver incident. The cars have caused a few deaths, by the fault of the car and not the driver.  It is likely that will happen at least a few more times.

And by virtue of it we get overall safer cars, a more sustainable mode of transportation, and a cleaner environment.

It's not perfection. Not remotely enough for the environment.

And then, instead of reporting any said evidence to the authorities, would just post a tweet on it? Is that really the action of a man who has any proof of a crime to show anyone? 

I think it's safe to say Musk has zero evidence whatsoever. It's clearly the behaviour of someone who thinks he is untouchable because of his wealth and believes he can get away with anything. Good thing he's about to be held accountable for his slurs.

To make it worse, his personality cult joined in and started barraging authorities with bullshit and threats. 

Then he tries to leverage his fame to destroy one of the rescuers who had the ~~cajones~~ cojones to point out how fucking stupid the whole thing was. The fact that Elon's brain goes straight to ""kidfucker"" with no evidence says much more about his inner workings than anyone else's.

Note here: there's a reason public figures avoid visiting places like disaster zones while rescue operations are still ongoing. Elon knew his visit would be a resource suck.

He's maybe 30% legitimate genius who can scrape together enough proofs of concept to draw in investors and get contracts, but surprise! Turns out the other 70% is an ugly mixture of snake oil salesman/shady finance weirdo/sociopath. And the Trump-esque twitter meltdowns are the cherry on top. 

Additionally, he's doing a really good job at demonstrating that hyperwealth is a mental illness. Like, there is a clear pathology and progression of the disease. It's like hoarding, except every newspaper you pile up in the hallway gets you a tee time with a Senator.

He may be the best example of it, because his ""big visions"" on how to improve the human condition actually seemed sincere in the beginning. If you can go from ""visionary humanist"", to ""surly teen"", to ""toddler throwing temper tantrums because you have enough money to pay for settlements/judgments in libel suits"", then you've clearly developed some kind of pathology caused by having too many zeroes in your bank account.

There was some talk about the Democrats trying to run him as a presidential candidate in 2020. I hope the last month or so of his public persona has buried that idea and rammed a stake through its heart to keep it from rising again.

I grew up where things like pedo or calling someone a homosexual was the norm. Now Elon fires shots over twitter and homeboy wants to sue. As if this guys character is defamed ? Nobody believes hes a pedo. Barely sounds like a real accusation. From Elon’s tweet seems like something more of an insult in passing than a direct accusation.

Thats fine even if this guy wins and gets a few bucks doesnt change much for Elon. Sounds like this guy is just capitalizing on the situation. I mean Id love to get called pedo by a very rich man.

And dont forget, this guy went looking for a rise out of Elon. Saying his submarine was useless even though he donated it for future rescues. With rich intelligent people all over the world who sit around and do nothing for society, it bothers me one of those guys tries to help and gets shat on by this dude.

Its not right what Elon said but he was provoked. To say this other fella is totally in the right is a quick conclusion. But Elons not just throwing Pedo around. Its also worth noting that with all the good Elon does, I can live with this being his worst. Make eco friendly bricks for a  third of the price for humanity ? Dope. Calls a dude a pedo ? Ehhhh let it slide the dudes trying to save the world and this guy was an asshole.

Seriously if it was someone without money this dude wouldve just taken the insult and moved on. How many people have you sued for calling you something everyone knows your not ? Its outrageous.

If he can dupe a judge into agreeing with that I’m sure Elon will fill up an unmanned submarine filled with 75k in 5 bills and send it on over.

Assuming it’s legit baseless, Elon definitely crossed a line. But this dude started this shit storm by accusing Elon of being a shitty person with less than honorable intentions. Which I believe to definitely be false. Elon has so much shit to do on a daily basis that knowingly developing a sub that wouldn’t work for the sole purpose of getting fame and recognition is ridiculous.

He had no evidence of that, same as Musk calling him a pedo. One could say this guy discredited his submarine he knew nothing about too.

Are you familiar with defamation/libel laws and how they work? It's not defamation to simply call a person names. 

It's only defamation when your statements can be presumed as factual like if you are someone with direct knowledge and you are offering first hand testimony that this person is in fact a pedo. 

Passively calling someone on twitter a pedo is a dick move but it's not defamation. 

Essentially if I call you a rapist it's not defamation/libel, if I say I was a witness and have first hand knowledge that you are in fact a rapist it's defamation/libel. 

The person filing is outside of the US and that could impact the lawsuit but within the US Elon's statements likely do not meet the criteria for definition/liable.

I think his engineering team deserves respect for their ingenuity. Given limited time, they came up with a prototype that, while it ended up not working within the constraints, at least was functional. And if it *had* worked within the constraints, it could have been very useful. So while Elon himself was just there for publicity, his team were still working towards the same goal as all the other rescuers. You should not judge a fish by its ability to climb trees; likewise don't judge an engineer by their ability to cave dive. They were engineers working on a problem, and presented an engineering-based solution that was ultimately not successful or needed. There is nothing wrong with that. And you might find yourself using a dildotorp in another rescue someday. Who knows?

I think it's important not to sway too strong in either direction with the cult of celebrity. Just as it's not healthy to idolize these people, it's not healthy to hate them.

Kids are saved in part by British divers who spend a lot of time in Thailand diving in caves

Elon musk simultaneously builds a small submarine to be used in the rescue

The kids are rescued without the submarine 

One of the British divers goes on tv and says musk can shove his submarine up his ass

Musk gets salty and calls him a pedo due the time he spends in Thailand which is supposedly somewhat infamous as a refuge for such behavior.

Eventually he backs down and apologized and everyone thought it was all over

Months later he remarks on Twitter how it’s curious that if the guy wasn’t a pedo he isn’t suing musk over the allegations. 

Diver now gets mad triggered, insists he will sue and has now apparently actually filed suit.

People care because it’s Elon musk. If he actually has dirt on the guy this is an impressively calculated and over the top way to get at the guy. The main evidence supporting this angle is of course that Elon appears to have gone out of his way to bait this guy into this. Elon fans will of course lap this stuff up.

If he doesn’t have anything and just randomly called him names and then goaded him into suing just cause he wants to throw his weight around it undermines to some extent the narrative Elon tries to build around himself as a good person out to improve the human species. The Elon haters are of course always out for blood and would love to have this to throw at him.

I personally don’t think it makes a difference either way. People are good at some things and bad at others. People can have good intentions in the big picture, they can even accomplish great things, but they can still be shitty in person. Elon is not known for his amazing people skills firstly so if the worst version turns out true I don’t see how it’s news and if the slightly better version is true I still think it might be a little petty and still isn’t really news.",news,t2_634g4,9gmml2,e66b0hw,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/e66b0hw/,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/

UK libel law reverses the burden of proof: when suing someone for libel, it’s up to the defendant to prove that what they said was true.

Under [28 U.S.C. § 1332](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1332), you generally can't bring a private lawsuit against someone in federal court unless ""the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000."" Therefore, it's standard practice when you file a lawsuit in federal court to declare that you've suffered damages ""in excess of $75,000."" 

Then the media takes that number (which is a placeholder number just to establish eligibility to sue in federal court) and says, falsely, that the plaintiff is ""seeking $75,000 in damages."" In reality, the actual amount of damages will be set during a settlement or after trial, and in this case will likely be substantially higher. But the media aren't lawyers, and often don't know this detail about eligibility to sue in federal court, and therefore you get this ""so-and-so is suing for $75,000"" thing repeated over and over again.

And according to the lawsuit, Unsworth says he's actually never *been* to the real Pattaya Beach, the one Elon Musk said is basically just for sex trafficking (which is a huge slur against Thailand in general, too). So clearly Musk heard the guy talking about ""Pattaya Beach"" and went ""Oh so clear he means the real thing and so obviously's he's a pedophile,"" which shows you had badly Musk fucked up here.

Oh, and also, [from reading the lawsuit](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4895822-Vernon-Unsworth-v-Elon-Musk-09-17-2018.html), Musk's claim that Unsworth has been going to Thailand for ""30-40 years"" is completely full of shit.

This is incorrect. From my other comment ITT

>$75k is the threshold for subject matter jurisdiction, he literally has to allege greater than $75k in damages to get into federal court. Like if you tried to file in state superior court for $10 in damages, you'd get kicked to small claims instead.

>So if you want to get out of small claims, you allege damages that are greater than the small claims limitation ($15k in my state). To get into federal court, you need 1) diversity, and 2) amount in controversy exceeds $75k. So you claim greater than $75k in damages.

I don't think the bar for ""not libelous"" is that high; even just video of the guy going into a child brothel would be enough I'd think, because libel means ""I said things knowing they were untrue"", and if you even saw a guy going to a child brothel then it's hard to prove that you *knew* he was no pedophile.

And it makes you (or at least me) wonder: if I were rich and calling someone a pedophile, the first thing I'd do is hire a private investigator or ten.  Not only would it cost nothing (in the grand scheme of things for Musk), but it would cost even less than nothing in a 3rd world country.

And if that didn't work, I'd have them do shady stuff to make it at least *look* like the guy was a pedophile.  If you have so few morals you accuse an innocent man of pedophillia, framing him (and not even in the ""go to jail"" sense, just the ""get Musk out of libel"" sense) would hardly be much worse.",news,t2_634g4,9gmml2,e65qg5j,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/e65qg5j/,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/

Jesus Christ...*everything* is a circle jerk, I guess.  Some people agree on something?  Circlejerk.  

Some people agree on one aspect of a thing, but have philosophical disagreements on other aspects? Circlejerk.

People talking anything under any circumstances for any reason?  Circlejerk.

But what else *should* this thread have?  Musk publicly accused some guy of being a paedo just because the guy hurt his feelings.  Should *anyone* here be defending Musk?

But in that vein: any other time I've seen this story come up anywhere that allows comments, there's been a dedicated, vocal group of Musk cultists who eagerly drop steaming apologetics into the rhetorical punchbowl.  *That's* what the comment you're replying to was talking about.

from [here](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/13/uk/thai-cave-rescue-british-divers-intl/index.html)

>British caver Vern Unsworth, 63, who lives in Chiang Rai, was instrumental in linking up the Thai authorities with the British experts. ""I was actually scheduled to go into the cave on June 24 anyway,"" Unsworth told CNN in an interview in Thailand.""I got all my gear ready, and I was going in to do a solo trip just to see what the water levels were like. And I got called out at 2 o'clock Sunday morning, and I was there for the whole 17 days.""
Unsworth's role in the rescue was also pivotal because of his intimate knowledge of the Tham Luang cave system, which he describes as his ""second home"" after spending the past six years exploring it.
He had been involved in cave rescue operations in the UK before, but ""nothing on this scale.""
It was Unsworth who initally pinpointed where he thought the Wild Boars team would be waiting. They were found 200 meters away from that point, which was ""probably around about the best place they could have been,"" he said.
The flooding of the cave could not have been predicted, he said, as the floodwater had come through three to four weeks earlier than last year.
""These kids were just totally unlucky. Wrong place, wrong time,"" he said. ""It happened very quick. You can't blame the coach, you can't blame the kids.""

And stop putting words into the divers mouth. He did not use such language. This is some blatant slandering to try and make elon's actions seem less of an overreaction. What did that diver do to you? Did he call you names too? Is that why you're slandering him now?

Maybe when the guy who was actually of help to the rescue effort tells you your project is worthless, the right thing to do is reflect on whether it is worthless, instead of lashing out like a 12 year old. 

>Someone insults me I insult them back too. Maybe Elon should counter sue for being accused of using the tragedy as a PR stunt.

Then he would have to prove he isn't doing it as a PR stunt. Good luck with that. ",news,t2_634g4,9gmml2,e65fho2,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/e65fho2/,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/

Under English (not sure about Scottish law which is a bit different) and English-tradition legal systems you can sue for any alleged libel. The burden of proof is on the person making the allegations. But assuming they have proof, this proof will then be placed on record for the court.

But in the US I'm pretty sure you can sue for libel in the same way, the difference being that in the US the burden of proof is on the person allegedly libeled to demonstrate that this has negatively impacted their reputation. 

So as I understand it, in this case, in an English court *Elon* has to prove that his allegations were true. In a US court *the diver* would have to prove Elon was making false allegations and that his reputation had been damaged as a result. 

Edited to add as per u/Codoro that in the UK itself libel law works differently for public figures, eg members of government, state officials etc- if you are one you're generally fair game for allegations against your behaviour as a public figure. The diver is, of course, not a public figure so this doesn't apply to him.

However the burden of proof is on the respondent: you said it, you need to prove it is true.  Only on Balance of probabilities, as this is a civil suit, but you have no access to law enforcement and limited powers of discovery: the plaintiff doesn’t have to be helpful.  And if it turns out you had to idea whether it was true when you said it and now are scrabbling around and failing to prove it then that is a bad look: you were reckless as to the truth of what you said, which may up the damages.   In practice there are other defences (honest opinion, for example) which are easier.  

But Uk libel law was radically reformed five years ago, so it’s all rather new territory (honest opinion is a new defence).  No juries, for a start off, which makes it harder to appeal to emotion (for both sides).  And unlike in some cases of the past, the bona fides of rich powerful men are not a given.  So the days of London being the libel capital of the world, on flimsy “well, I know I am Russian, he is Russian, and it was published in Russia in Russian, but my aunt’s cleaner has a box of shortbread her sister brought back from holiday” theories are over.

>""We're worried about the smallest lad please keep working on the capsule details,"" Stanton told Musk.

The diver sueing musk was the first on the scene because he lived there but he wasn't one of the divers who went to find the boys, his role was recommending stanton and another diver to the thai government as the best out there for a cave rescue operation. 

So it's a little absurd that unsworth was the one who recommended stanton, and stanton was the one telling musk to complete and deliver the submarine, and unsworth goes and shits all over the submarine that the guy HE recommended for the rescue operation wanted. Stanton was actually one of the divers who went all the way into the cave, if anyone should know if the sub was worth a chance it would be him or the other divers who went all the way in.

What if Elon Musk really DID have proof that the diver was a pedo?

So he baits the guy into suing him, by double and then triple downing on his comment, and then saying that if the guy really isnt a pedo, he should sue him.

Now, how stupid would Elon Musk have be to really do all of that with no evidence? Real dumb, and i would agree with every bit of hate he is getting for it.

But what if he wanted to out this guy in a more official way, and drain his pocket while doing it, because Musk knows that he is actually a pedophile and told him to shove his work to try to save children up his ass?

That's what I'm talking about. Musk's clearly got issues. (I buy the stories about him using drugs as a crutch to fuel his high speed life.) But that doesn't make him worse than Bezos or Trump or the Kochs or Murdoch as far as evil businessmen go. He's still ultimately trying to advance humanity.

First, I have never heard the term pedo used as a casual insult, but that is all a moot point because Elon Musk said, and I quote:

>He's an old, single white guy from England who has been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 or 40 years, mostly Pattaya Beach, until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time. There's only one reason people go to Pattaya Beach. It isn't where you go for caves, but it is where you'd go for something else. Chiang Rai is renowned for child sex-trafficking.

It's not about ""pedo guy"" anymore.

He straight up said the dude had a child bride.",news,t2_634g4,9gmml2,e66b2ah,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/e66b2ah/,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/

The same sources calling Verne Unsworth one of the divers? Of course they wouldn't mention that when they can't get simple facts right. Verne wasn't a diver but he was vital to the rescue effort. He was a cave expert, someone who knew that cave intimately. He correctly identified which chamber the boys would be in giving the rescue effort a clear goal. He aided the divers with his knowledge of the cave system with maps and personal experience. He recommended the British divers to the Thai government. He wasn't a diver but he was of vital importance to the operation.

Does the media give him his proper credit for what he did? No. They steal credit from the divers, give it to him, throw his credit away, and let the ignorant froth at the mouth over fabricated drama. Same reason why they asked Verne about the fucking sub, same reason why they only published his opinion and no one else's. They wanted drama, controversy; they especially wanted Elon to give a nasty rebuttal and boy did he deliver. News for weeks! And nothing more about the rescue itself just about two men slinging cruel words at each other.

That's not true for defamation per se, which this very clearly is. Harm is assumed as an element of the cause of action, and the dollar amount of harm is only calculated for awarding compensatory damages.

In the end it comes down to the journalist themselves to decide what to do with the information learned and is whatever piece of scoop they might have on their hands worth ignoring the gentlepersons' agreement and risking their relationship with the interviewee (+word of it going around = harder to land big interviews in the future).

Things like ethics and shitty personalities/culture are only ""excuses"" for investment firms to withdraw their funds when the financial metrics are bad. It's so much easier to say that you withdraw from X evil company instead of admitting that you did a bad investment choice.

One, the more likely you are to know something the less likely it is to be taken as giving your opinion (which would protect you from defamation).  So, if you said your neighbor was a pedophile that's more likely to be understood as a claim of fact. Conversely, if you're just saying that an old guy traveling to Thailand is a pedophile when you don't know him - that's more likely opinion. 

The other point you connect to is the idea of ""public figure."". The definition actually seems pretty easy to meet. I wouldn't be surprised if being in the news and having a spat with Musk qualified. In which case, as you say, you'd need to prove malice.

As such, Elon Musk accusing people of pedophilia is a reasonable response.""

Those aren't connected. The media can have ethical issues without Musk accusing anyone of pedophilia. Additionally, Musk doesn't have an adversarial relationship with media. He actively plays to them. Even in this scenario, he started talking directly to news outlets.

Hell, during the actual event he was screen-shotting emails and giving them to news outlets. I mean the guy clearly just loves the attention he gets. The emails themselves show little more than self-aggrandizement, [as you can see here,](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1016684366083190785) where he's basically like ""YEAH I HAVE THE BEST ENGINEERS IN THE WORLD ON THIS, THEY BUILD SPACESHIPS, DID I MENTION THEY ARE ROCKET SCIENTISTS?"" while craning his neck to see who's watching.

He could have built it and moved on, but he actually is just a media dramamonger himself, who elevates every single affront like he's a two-bit rapper trying to beef with the big kids. It's completely transparent. Ultimately he is attempting to gain wealth and fame. Probably he wants to do something so amazing he gets into history books. To do that he makes wild claims and chooses hairbrained schemes with small payouts in the greater trajectory of human history, but that entrance the population. Since he's probably a narcissist, he feels that he can lash out at anyone who insults him without repercussion. He calls someone a pedophile and basically begs the guy to sue him because he thinks he's above the law, above punishment, because he thinks absolutely everyone loves him. He insults the media whenever they don't do what he wants, but flagrantly panders to them himself, stirring whatever he can, inserting himself into whatever story he can.

I'm pretty ready for the honeymoon to end with Musk. In the end he's just another narcissistic capitalist born into wealth and provided an excellent education.

People are seriously deluding themselves if they think this is going to result in a successful defamation suit. How many unfounded accusations of sexual assault have you witnessed in the past several years? How many of them resulted in any defamation suits being filed against the accuser? I'd give it at best a 15% chance of this going anywhere in the US court.

It's also dubious grounds for the diver to sue in the UK court. Setting the precedence a country can sue foreigners who breach their speech laws would be insane. Saudi Arabia and Iran could sue Americans for blasphemy against Islam. North Korea could sue people for insulting dear leader. And so on.

You are falling for some media source's drama narrative.



> ""Anyway, to expand a bit more on the details here:

> Narongsak Osotthanakorn, the provincial governor quoted by BBC, went on to say: “Even though their equipment is technologically sophisticated, it doesn't fit with our mission to go in the cave.” In other words, the problem wasn’t that the sub was useless. It was that they’d already come up with an alternate plan before the sub arrived. (Note: Narongsak was actually transitioning out as governor. He just stayed on as the political head of the rescue team until it was completed.)""

If I was looking to buy an electric car, my primary concern would be range, second reliability. NOT whether it has a ""ludicrous mode"" and fancy handleless doors or an ipad for a dashboard.

A lot of Tesla's design is a solution looking for a problem. The drive train? Great, not hi G wrong there, but car companies perfected the door handle decades ago. Sure, there are add-ons, unique ideas on that space, but ultimately 99% of cars have fully functional door handles that nobody ever needs to think about. You pull the handle, the door opens. If you spend more than a second working out how to open a door, the design is a failure. 

Tesla is trying to be unqie, and I can respect that, but they have a lot to learn about what makes a great car. A great car isn't just about the speed, or the looks, or the technology. It's also about the little things. Where buttons fall, the placement of the interior lights, the door handles. If you can't get those basic yet vital components right, you need to think about the design.

> Musk was optimistic about the future success of the money transfer business Confinity was developing. Musk and then-president and CEO of X.com, Bill Harris, disagreed on this point and Harris left the company in May 2000. In October of that year, Musk made the decision that X.com would terminate its other Internet banking operations and focus on the PayPal money service.

Harris wasn't sold on the money transfer service and ended up leaving over a power struggle with Elon, who then shut down basically EVERYTHING at X.com in order to focus entirely on PayPal.

You couldn’t be more wrong. 

Even in a clear case, there’s a phase of lawsuits called discovery, which is essentially the first *real* phase of a case. It’s the one where you get to request documents from the other side, take depositions, etc. 

Folks who’ve gone against big corporations often refer to discovery as the “drowning stage.”  You and your attorneys are intentionally inundated with an insurmountable number of court filings, requests for documents or information, etc. It’s probably the most heavily abused aspect of our civil judicial system. I can get further into why/how all of that occurs if anyone is curious, but I’ll skip that for now.  Point is, the fundamental assumption you’re working with is flawed in the *legal* context — forget about public image. 

And yet on top of that, the average person couldn’t care less what’s legally proven these days. They just don’t care. And we’ve seen it a million times — the court of public opinion is not the same thing as the court of law. People’s lives can be absolutely *devastated* by baseless allegations. The mere association of your name and a nefarious crime is enough to ruin you.

So maybe it won’t “go away” for someone like Elon Musk, but I would encourage you to look at what these suits do to the little guys who start them, and the way in which they become less than a footnote in the lives of people like Elon, Trump, etc.  I’m not saying any of that’s right, but it’s a reality that you’re somewhat naive to ignore.

I'd rather have a high end Tesla, i think that buying Tesla would encourage more electric car manufacturing. I wish i could afford it. But if you can afford it, i think you should buy a high-end Tesla. I think Elon and Tesla will be okay. He's pretty smart. And people that smart and that rich and that powerful do tend to be arrogant. So he shoots his mouth off a little. I like that he expresses himself, rather than being all careful about what he says, to the extent of being fake like a politician. 

I think the cave diver that Elon called a pedo started the animosity by being very insulting towards Elon. I think that cave diver is jealous as hell of Elon. Elon lost his cool, but maybe the word around the cave rescue, supports what Elon says. The kids were in a hot and humid and dark environment, they were frightened and weak, dependent, and heavily sedated. Many good men were involved, but the vulnerable condition of the kids will also appeal to a pedo.  It's my understanding that Elon and the cave diver suing did not meet in Thailand. Maybe the word around the cave rescue was that this man's interest in children is inappropriate. Was this the guy who got to the kids right away and spent the whole time with the kids in the cave? 

This is what Elon said about the guy at one point:

He blasted: ""He's an old, single white guy from England who's been travelling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years, mostly Pattaya Beach, until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.

""There's only one reason people go to Pattaya Beach. It isn't where you go for caves, but it is where you'd go for something else.

""Chiang Rai is renowned for child sex-trafficking.""

If he did marry a 12 year old, i don't think he has a case against Elon. Most people consider sex with a 12 year old rape, because they are too young to consent. Anyone having sex with a teen or preteen young enough to be their child or grandchild has something wrong with him (or her).

Edit: Look at me collecting the downvotes! There are a lot of pervs on Reddit. Downvoting me for condemning sex with kids. How would you like to ""marry"" a middle aged man when your brain isn't half developed? You can't support yourself, defend yourself, or get away?  Idiots. If Elon does think the guy is a pedophile, I'm glad he has the guts to say it. You don't need to catch a guy in the act to know what he's up to. I listened to what this cave diver guy said about Elon, and i thought he was a creep.

Of course there are bad ones but I honestly don’t think they outweigh the good. I spent a good portion of my childhood around missionary families in a 3rd world country (my family weren’t missionaries but we sometimes participated in missionary activities with friends of ours) and they did many good things in our community such as providing English language education to convicts to help them get jobs (speaking English made you very employable in this country), giving toys and food (and also English lessons) to impoverished children, building houses and planting sustainable gardens for families, driving people to and from their jobs if they needed (and besides that, employing many locals with well paying jobs in the ministry), providing a safe place to stay to those who were in need (in their own homes very often) and many, many other things.

Every single missionary I met during this time in my life, the adults and even their children (who didn’t choose to be missionaries obviously), were filled with such empathy for those around them and such grace and kindness and an unfaltering drive to go out and do good, to really improve the lives of the people around them, the likes of which I have rarely seen since returning to the US. These people truly found joy in the prosperity of others.

And yes of course they were Christians and they spread the word of God when they could, but what’s important is that they helped people, all people, regardless of whether or not they chose to believe in God, there was no “requirement” to be helped by them except needing help. In fact many people in this country were already Christian (Catholic specifically so different but considered Christian by most Protestants) and so didn’t even need to be “saved” but still needed help.",news,t2_634g4,9gmml2,e666fjt,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/e666fjt/,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/

Yeah, like most other people who get called out after making crass insults he apologized. Nothing about this apology indicates that the original statement was intended to be a factual claim that the diver committed a crime as opposed to a generic insult. 

> He wrote it to a journalist. It was not ""leaked"", nor was it ""off the record"" as Musk claims.

""off the record"" is literally the first sentence of the email...

> It's already precedent. The only insane thing would be pretending foreigners are above the law.

No. No it is not. Crimes are almost always tried where the crimes took place. Plenty of people make make statements that are against the law in other countries and face no consequences. When countries *do* try to enforce their speech laws outside their borders, it makes headlines - perhaps the most notable recent example is Thailand pulling strings to have people arrested outside the country for insulting the monarchy.

Listen, sweetheart, your point got destroyed before you could ever make it because you automatically assumed I was anti-union. 

I am for some, not for others. I sure as hell don’t need the union where I work because we’ve got an amazing relationship with our municipality, and they, and the community love us. Our contract is literally only for vacation/pay/benefits — we’ve never filed a grievance, and we likely never will because we have open communication. I could leave it tomorrow and nothing would happen. I’m not in it for my benefit, nor that of my family.

My dad left his union to take a management job, and is significantly happier. My mom left her union job in the 70’s when she had kids, she didn’t care about being union or not, she just needed the job at the time. My grandpa worked in a shop where it was absolutely necessary. 

My point is that, there are absolutely unions that are abusive to its membership, and there are others that are corrupt. 

If you want to be part of one, go for it, if not, that’s probably also fine. It comes down to what’s best for you and your family. 

The situation with Tesla/Elon is pretty simple. Here’s the job, if you don’t like it, you can leave — if you organize you’ll probably be fired. Union busting has been going on since the 1900’s.... it’ll never end. Its not that I agree with the idea, or the thought behind it. But it’s just the facts. 

If you are going to organize. It’s a two way street, both on the employer, and the employee....

The UAW, which, is probably one of the worst out there and has been the cause of pushing for automation by auto manufacturers, is the one behind the Tesla stuff. 

They feel that the employees at Tesla should be part of the UAW, and per normal, want to strengthen their bargaining position at the table. The problem seems to be two fold. Elon is treating his employees well enough they don’t want to organize, and the few that were probably disgruntled enough to try were ousted which is why the UAW went ballistic. And of course they are going to because the union stalwarts who think it’s the only way will yell and scream until it happens.  They’ll end up with a shitty contract when it happens. 

Musk has put a ton of work in to automation where it’s necessary, and it has to learn how to be a mass production car company, and he’s going to keep going and the only people that are going to be on the production floor are going to be a handful of people to oversee the robots as they work.

Have you ever heard the saying ""Aside from that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?""  Basically, the point you're ignoring is kind of a big deal.  

You're right though.  Apart from pioneering in rocketry Elon really hasn't done much.  He's basically your average redditor.  His accomplishments - PayPal, working with Solar City, the Boring company, and starting the first new major American car company since Jeep, repeatedly becoming a billionaire, that's all pretty mediocre, average stuff.  Yawn, what a phony.

I'm being sarcastic of course.  His accomplishments are fairly mind blowing.  Trying to describe him as not doing ""anything extraordinary"" is absurd.

Musk shouldn't have called the guy a pedophile.  We both agree on that.  As I mentioned, nobody is perfect though.  It's an error and Musk deserves to face consequences for it.  It doesn't make him some loathsome pariah though.",news,t2_634g4,9gmml2,e6699xg,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/e6699xg/,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/

But Elon is a little different because his ability to act is largely dependent on the persona he's built up. Ordinary consumers visibly rejecting Tesla products *because of him* is something that might well have an impact because consumers wouldn't be rejecting the fundamentals of the business model, but one guy. If people are therefore motivated by antipathy toward Musk then a boycott based on *him* is likely to see his power base become more insecure. As it is the board of directors isn't hugely happy with him. 

This isn't like Nestle where boycotts won't do shit because Nestle couldn't address these concerns without severely affecting their bottom line.

Musk put all of the companies resources towards PayPal and shut down effectively all of the online banking aspects of X.com. Just because the service existed didn't mean it was going to be successful without Musk investing all of X.com's resources towards the service. 

Thousands of services have been invented that you've never heard of because resources weren't dedicated to the service. Musk did just that: ALL of the companies resources were dedicated to PayPal and that's the fundamental reason PayPal became what it did.

That just proves you have no idea how ""off the record"" works.

The journalist never agreed that this was otr. Simply saying ""oh, and this is all off the record, of course"" does not make everything you just said magically otr.

>No. No it is not. Crimes are almost always tried where the crimes took place.

Unfortunately, there is no ""internet court"". I assume Musk was in the US when he said these things? Either way, he said them as a US citizen, against a British citizen.

>yes people absolutely are not subject to laws of a country they are not in.

I was originally referring to foreigners as in a Canadian on US soil being subject to American laws.

But you are still wrong.

Just a few days ago (8 August), a US court ruled against Canadian scammers targeting US citizens.

EA, a US-based company, is being charged with violating Belgian gambling laws.

It makes sense. Sure, you latched onto cases of, say, executing someone for drug offenses, but if I scam a British citizen of their money, they can sue me in British court, and I can be found guilty.

The question really is, what leverage does the country have? There is jack shit that the Iranian government can do to me, so I really don't care if they charge me with blasphemy. However, EA can be fined, Musk, if he has any assets in Britain, can have them seized until he pays, and a Canadian convicted of fraud may well be arrested by Canadian authorities and sent to the US. Similarly, the US would likely extradite me if I was charged in a Canadian court for threatening a Canadian citizen, but it would not extradite me to Iran if I was charged with blasphemy.

It's not as simple as saying ""Ha, ha, I'm immune, you can't catch me, even though I committed a crime!"". Jurisdiction over foreigners or national on foreign soil is a very difficult matter. Throw in the internet, where perpetrator and victim can be anywhere in the world at the time, and it only gets messier.

Until twitter court is a thing (god help us), then it only makes sense to sue Musk in the US or Britain, possibly Thailand as (I think?) he was there at the time.

No. They are competing with current Toyota and Ford. If they offer a product expected to last a long time at a certain price point, as a consumer, I will compare it to other products at that price point. Per the second article, the model 3's pass rate (14%) is 5 times less than other competitive vehicle plants.

>A competitive plant will pass 80%-plus vehicles that do not require repair. I would say the average plant is about a 65-80% range,"" said Ron Harbour, a consultant at Oliver Wyman who founded and writes ""The Harbour Report,"" a worldwide guide to manufacturing.

I am sure that Tesla's production problems wouldn't be quite as dramatic if they didn't aggressively ignore how the market leaders do things. But instead Elon would prefer to boast about how ""revolutionary"" his factory is, without realizing that he still has plenty to learn from the big boys in the field. 

The Tesla factory is the old Toyota factory, where they introduced the Toyota Production System, which revolutionized manufacturing and dramatically raised quality standards. He aggressively ignores established standards and practices in the field for what sounds good, his product suffers, and then he backtracks once he realizes that maybe, just maybe, he doesn't know absolutely everything about absolutely every field.

He brags about how humans are overrated in manufacturing, and how slow the Toyota factories are in comparison to how he thought the Model 3 production would go. You know what happened? His overly robotic production line moves at a fraction of the speed that Toyota's stuff does, his QC is utter garbage compared to Toyota, and the only reason he's hitting his targets on Model 3 production is because the entire damn company (humans) worked on those production lines. 

>You cant hate on one company without a real comparison

I'm comparing them to their competitors, in the current market. 

Fucking hell, there is nothing revolutionary about Teslas from a manufacturing perspective.

Simply saying ""oh, and this is all off the record, of course"" does not make everything you just said magically otr.

Sure, the journalist didn't do anything illegal. The point remains, though, that these statements are were not publicly made. Musk made these statements in confidence, Buzzfeed chose to make these statements public. This is why the falsely accused fraternities sued the Rolling Stone, not the anonymous accuser a few years back.

> Unfortunately, there is no ""internet court"". I assume Musk was in the US when he said these things? Either way, he said them as a US citizen, against a British citizen.

So, the belief is that that Iran *can* enforce its blasphemy laws against US citizens? Or Thailand's lese-majeste laws against Americans that insult their monarchy. In fact, the latter is nearly exactly analogous to this situation. An individual in the US made a statement against another individual which is against the law in the latter's country. Again, after exercising a little thought it becomes clear how ridiculous this proposal is. Plenty of countries, even relatively liberal ones like Germany, make it illegal to insult heads of state. Plenty of Americans do it without consequence.

> EA, a US-based company, is being charged with violating Belgian gambling laws.

They operate in Belgium. EA committed a crime *in Belgium*. Multinational companies are different from people in that they can have a presence in multiple countries at once.

> It makes sense. Sure, you latched onto cases of, say, executing someone for drug offenses, but if I scam a British citizen of their money, they can sue me in British court, and I can be found guilty.

Most scammers are tried in their country of origin. At least all the cases I have followed. That's why they often operate out of 3rd world countries, or countries that don't cooperate with western democracies.

> It's not as simple as saying ""Ha, ha, I'm immune, you can't catch me, even though I committed a crime!"". Jurisdiction over foreigners or national on foreign soil is a very difficult matter. Throw in the internet, where perpetrator and victim can be anywhere in the world at the time, and it only gets messier.

No, it does not. There's nothing to catch because they have not committed a crime. Their actions are legal where they are located. You're trying to rationalize the belief that somehow a person is bound by the laws of a country they are not in. I can nearly guarantee you that every week you do something that would be a crime in another country, and you don't face any consequences for it. Heck, the same thing exists within US states. You can go to a gun range in Nevada and shoot a gun with a pistol grip, flash hider, or any other number of banned features across the State in California. You can shoot porn in California or Florida (something illegal in most States) and distribute the videos nation-wide.

> You are making massive generalizations about incredibly complicated matters you obviously know or have thought nothing about.

No, you're the one who doesn't know what they're talking about. [Here's concrete example of something like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Elcom_Ltd.).

Here is a famous example from the UK of a falsely accused pedophile being murdered.

I guarantee you both Unsworth and Musk have both received death threats. This is a fairly notable internet fight, that is the nature of these things. Most death threats, legitimate or otherwise are handled privately between the threatened and the police if at all.

My conclusion was increased probability of murder. Like basically raising it from 0.00001% to 0.0001% type deal. Hell, even if someone comes at with a knife or a gun you are statistically more likely to get away than get murdered. Honestly, I'm quite sure Musk never INTENDED to raise the odds of murder. He probably just wanted to ruin the guy's life.

No, absolutely not. Next time read a little, would you? They can convict away. Actually enforcing that conviction is a whole other matter, and, as I gave some examples of, you are not free to violate the laws of another country and expect zero repercussion. Especially once extradition treaties get involved.

>Their actions are legal where they are located.

It sounds like what Musk did is a crime in the US and the UK.

>I can nearly guarantee you that every week you do something that would be a crime in another country, and you don't face any consequences for it.

You have a fundamental misunderstanding of law. Conviction is NOT equal to being punished. I could, as I said before, be convicted of a crime in Iran. And found guilty. There is nothing stopping the Iranian government from considering me a criminal. However, the US will almost certainly not extradite me for that.

For example, the US and Canada have an extradition treaty. That means that yes, I can be convicted of a crime in Canada and yes, the US will extradite me. However, one of the terms of the treaty is that the crime must be a crime in *both* countries. If Canada convicts me of something that is not illegal in the US, the US is not required to extradite me (it might still, but that is another matter). I am guilty. I have bee convicted. I have not, yet, faced jail time, fines, etc. Canada may decide to freeze a Canadian bank account, if I had one, but that is about as far as they can get.

In that one example, it is true that he was found not guilty to to matters of juresdiction. **However, if what you claim is true, then he would have never even gone to court.** The fact that he was found not guilty is a matter of US law, and Americans deciding where the law does or does not apply. **If he was in another country, it is possible that he would have been convicted.**

Again, I gave you several examples that show that you *can* be convicted of a crime in a foreign country.

You know why? Because each country decides it's own laws. Technically, a country could rule *anyone* a criminal for some BS reason. However, they should not expect them to be extradited. I would not recommend traveling to that country, though.

Again, you have a fundamental misunderstanding. There is no ""universal rule"" that says a country's laws only apply to within it's borders. Who would make this rule? The limits of a country's laws are defined by the country itself, and perhaps various treaties that are party to.

But if you don't know what extradition is, then I cannot help you.",news,t2_634g4,9gmml2,e66hxqt,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/e66hxqt/,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/

I have known several people whon are pedos, i can tell by the way they look at the kid. I'm never wrong. Eventually the truth came out, but i had no way to prove it. 

When a murder happens and the detectives are trying to determine who did it, they might go to the funeral and videotape the mourners. They study each person's face, all through the event , looking for a micro-expression that reveals their true feelings towards the deceased. An expression that only lasts a split second can tell you all you need to know.  It's not admissable in court, but then the detectives have a lead that they can work on. Eventually, they can get warrants, go through the guy's computer and phone records, etc. and get the proof. Some people are very observant, and very good at reading people. Many many a person has figured out a criminal's true intentions with absolutely no proof, just a really good hunch. 

The point is, that you don't know what Elon knows. Why worry about it. If Elon is wrong, some guy is going to get a lot of money, and so are his lawyers. He'll get his day in court and Elon will have egg on his face and all the pervs will be very happy. Nobody better call anyone a pedo ever!

Next time read a little, would you? They can convict away. Actually enforcing that conviction is a whole other matter, and, as I gave some examples of, you are not free to violate the laws of another country and expect zero repercussion. Especially once extradition treaties get involved.

Sure they can. But they don't because it would be an act of idiocy. 

And again you have provided zero instances of someone being convicted for committing a crime by a country they were not present in, when those actions are legal in the country they were present in at the time of the supposed crime. I don't know why you keep insisting you have provided examples of this, because you haven't.

>It sounds like what Musk did is a crime in the US and the UK.

This is where you're deluding yourself. Speech protections in the US are very strong, and people rarely get convicted for defamation.

>You have a fundamental misunderstanding of law. Conviction is NOT equal to being punished. I could, as I said before, be convicted of a crime in Iran. And found guilty. There is nothing stopping the Iranian government from considering me a criminal. However, the US will almost certainly not extradite me for that.

>For example, the US and Canada have an extradition treaty. That means that yes, I can be convicted of a crime in Canada and yes, the US will extradite me. However, one of the terms of the treaty is that the crime must be a crime in *both* countries. If Canada convicts me of something that is not illegal in the US, the US is not required to extradite me (it might still, but that is another matter). I am guilty. I have bee convicted. I have not, yet, faced jail time, fines, etc. Canada may decide to freeze a Canadian bank account, if I had one, but that is about as far as they can get.

You're misunderstanding what extradition is. Extradition is when a someone commits a crime in one country and flees to another, the latter returns this person to the former for trial. It's not saying that one county's laws apply to another.

>In that one example, it is true that he was found not guilty to to matters of juresdiction.

This is exactly what I've been saying this whole time. Because Skylarov was I Russia at the time he committed the crimes he was charged with, the US had no jurisdiction over it. This is just a long-winded way of saying US laws don't apply to what he did in Russia.

> **However, if what you claim is true, then he would have never even gone to court.** The fact that he was found not guilty is a matter of US law, and Americans deciding where the law does or does not apply. **If he was in another country, it is possible that he would have been convicted.**

No, you can be brought to court regardless. The court would, as in Skylarov's case dismiss the charges due to lack of jurisdiction. That's what lack of jurisdiction means: the government doesn't have authority to persecute that crime.

>Again, I gave you several examples that show that you *can* be convicted of a crime in a foreign country.

No, you have not. Give me an example where an American had done something legal in America, while residing in America, and had been tried for those actions abroad (in developed countries like the UK).

>You know why? Because each country decides it's own laws. Technically, a country could rule *anyone* a criminal for some BS reason. However, they should not expect them to be extradited. I would not recommend traveling to that country, though.
>
>Again, you have a fundamental misunderstanding. There is no ""universal rule"" that says a country's laws only apply to within it's borders. Who would make this rule? The limits of a country's laws are defined by the country itself, and perhaps various treaties that are party to.

Yeah, and since countries can't enforce laws outside their borders without cooperation, and because most (all?) countries don't extradite their own residents for activities that are legal in their country the result is exactly what I've been saying this entire time: other countries' laws don't apply outside their borders. Talking about extradition treaties is just a long winded way of saying the same thing.

>But if you don't know what extradition is, then I cannot help you.

Yeah, and if you're insane enough to the US would extradite over defamation claims like these I can't help you either.",news,t2_634g4,9gmml2,e66krcq,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/e66krcq/,/r/news/comments/9gmml2/diver_who_helped_with_thai_cave_rescue_sues_elon/

SpaceX representatives were there. Hearsay through his staff.

Yeah I don't know his basis for the claims.

Jurisdiction does matter. Laws change a lot in that man's lifetime.

In a lot of places the minimum age is low or none. Plus different jurisdictions exist in a nation state. I know nothing about Thailand.

Of course not. I dislike people enough as it is, and that’s while able to lie to myself about them.

Yes he is. The way in which a person formulates their perspectives is what separates stupid from not. Genius is found in the ability to detach oneself from influence, both internal and external. To see without filter.

Whereas stupid people formulate perspectives like they shop for food. Walking through aisles, picking whatever prepackaged good they want in that moment, and passing over without a second look that which doesnt appeal to their immediate appetite.

“Smart” as you define it is siphoning off ideals you subjectively define of higher value. When the reality is those who hold ideas you find abhorrent formulated their views in the exact manner as those who hold ideas you admire. The difference between the two is illusory.

Elon Musk is a moron. He was born a moron. He will die a moron. It’s just what it is.

No, he isn't.  He wasn't convicted of anything.

This is from the SEC *directly* regarding this issue-

> Musk and Tesla have agreed to settle the charges against them without admitting or denying the SEC’s allegations.  Among other relief, the settlements require that:

> - Musk will step down as Tesla’s Chairman and be replaced by an independent Chairman.  Musk will be ineligible to be re-elected Chairman for three years;

> - Tesla will appoint a total of two new independent directors to its board;

> - Tesla will establish a new committee of independent directors and put in place additional controls and procedures to oversee Musk’s communications;

> - Musk and Tesla will each pay a separate $20 million penalty.  The $40 million in penalties will be distributed to harmed investors under a court-approved process.

* As of summer of 2018 - Flint probably has about as much or likely less lead in its water than whatever water you got from your tap this morning. That is to say that something like 97&#37; of homes are below the EPA compliance level. A home is not out of compliance with the lead and copper rule unless this falls below 90&#37;, as it *may* have back in 2015. Currently [5,300 municipal water systems are out of compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule](https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/28/us/epa-lead-in-u-s-water-systems/index.html) \- Flint is not, and formally has not been, one.
* In fact, the [latest round of sampling](http://www.michigan.gov/documents/flintwater/CLEAR_Round_3_597239_7.pdf) indicated the number of homes with lead contaminated water above levels which violate the Lead and Copper Rule is around 3&#37;, putting it well below what you'd find in just about any city in America at this point, especially ones with aged infrastructures. Further exploiting Flint and their lack of trust for political gain is a cheap attempt to capitalize on a situation which was terrible, but has been addressed appropriately with many lessons learned. We need to use these lessons so that we can work on making sure the thousands of other water systems in the United States with lead issues are addressed in similar ways to how the issue in Flint has been dealt with.
* Despite this, Flint has gotten $100m from the EPA and a $97m settlement from Michigan and repairs are underway as we speak to replace the service lines to tens of thousands of homes. They are fixing the aged infrastructure that was brought to light by the 2015 lead issues.
* The state stopped bottled water delivery in Flint because the water has [been below action levels for two years.](https://www.michigan.gov/snyder/0,4668,7-277-57577-465766--,00.html)
* There are still issues with lead in the water of certain cities throughout Michigan and the entire United States, but right now - Flint is not one of them. To say otherwise at this point lacks objectivity and is nothing but a partisan talking point. Unfortunately this has become a partisan topic, and I typically agree with liberals ideologically, but I can't put agenda before data, and I'd hope more of us can be objective on this.",news,t2_jl7ph4h,8y4eg8,e28fjb4,/r/news/comments/8y4eg8/elon_musk_pledges_to_fix_flint_mi_water_problem/e28fjb4/,/r/news/comments/8y4eg8/elon_musk_pledges_to_fix_flint_mi_water_problem/

A shit ton of us live in houses with lead pipes or have our water going through lead pipes  before reaching our houses, schools, or work water systems and we simply do not know it.

Same for Flint, do you think these people knew they had lead pipes?

We need a national program or something for us to know what is in our water and to replace lead pipes through out our nation.

But...the EPA can't and won't do that in the Trump Admin. So we might need to create something lead by citizens and non-profit NGOs to do it.

However, first, we need to know what is in our water and soil. So where do we go buy these kits and how do we know they are accurate?

The problem is that the elite doesn't want to pay for it, starting with the fact that they refuse to pay taxes at sane levels, a top tax bracket for the US that only goes to 30-something percent is totally freaking insane. 

Then add $1.5 trillion out of the yearly $3 trillion or so the US takes in in income tax that goes straight to the war machine in one way or the other, and it's absolutely no mystery why US infrastructure - including water for the citizens - is literally falling apart. 

There's no mystery here. Just lack of funds and total callous disregard by the 0.01% who don't care, because they don't live in Flint, and don't know anyone who lives in Flint. 

They do know their latest 100 room mansion with hot and cold running prostitutes looks great, though!

1.  Elon Musk assembles a team of chemical engineers at SpaceX, asks them to describe different ways to reverse chemical contamination of lead.
2.  One subset of engineers suggests treatment with a chemical compound that would dissolve an inner layer of the piping (thickness of penetration is in micrometers), chemical residue left by the compound is either set to deactivate after a certain amount of energy is lost/time expires (whichever is more plausible function for said compound).
3.  Another subset suggests a biochemical solution using plankton or other micro-organisms able to break down or process lead (though this kind of thing is plausible, the bio-engineering required would take years and the exact characteristics of the resulting organism may not be ideal).
4.  Yet another subset suggests using a sonic emissions system to make sections of pipe vibrate at a specific frequency while pumping a mixture of acid and minerals through the pipeline at a high speed in an attempt to break up the lead.
5.  Somebody will, inevitably, suggest filling the pipes with pressurized acetone.  They will likely be asked to leave.
6.  Another subset will suggest something to the effect of ""painting"" coats of metal inside the pipes to cover the lead.  Plausible, but probably not all too effective.
7.  Another subset makes the assertion that by introducing a heated chemical solution that reaches lead's melting point while still giving lead something else to bond to once it's melted, which is then siphoned out (I don't even want to think about the logistics for this one).
7.  Somebody else will, inevitably, suggest a solution dealing with radiation.  They will likely be asked to report to HR to receive their final paycheck.
8.  Musk will listen to these, in addition to a variety of other solutions, including the simple answer of just replacing all the pipes.  Each one will be weighed in cost and academic value, as well as industrial application re-use (recall that Musk reused a component from a rocket to create a submarine, then stated it had other uses besides his original intention).  Flint, MI will ultimately reject anything that means using equipment produced by one of Musk's companies or employment of a chemical process whose properties are not well established in the field.

In the end, whether or not Musk himself solves the problem directly, his commitment and call to attention towards the issue will prompt the government, as well as other companies, to investigate ways they can address the Flint crisis as well as similar problems across the country.  They will probably ignore the obvious solution, but at least they will work to achieve others.",news,t2_jl7ph4h,8y4eg8,e28ojvf,/r/news/comments/8y4eg8/elon_musk_pledges_to_fix_flint_mi_water_problem/e28ojvf/,/r/news/comments/8y4eg8/elon_musk_pledges_to_fix_flint_mi_water_problem/

""I live there. The issue is basically resolved. Even though lead levels are still elevated, they are now below EPA standards for drinking water in 98% of the houses originally tested, and continually falling as the pipe/water chemistry equalizes itself.

There is a plan to replace all lead-bearing service lines in all affected houses by 2020, and class-action lawsuits are ongoing to get compensation for potential mental disability in children caused by elevated lead levels. 

As of now, most of us are drinking the tap water again. To be fair, my house doesn't have a lead service line. I got my water tested by an independent laboratory in California just to be sure but I never had an issue with lead in my water, even though I am hooked up to the Flint municipal supply.""

Without the word ""fund"", it makes it sound like Musk is going to invent some new technology, which would understandably be met with cynicism. Musk has money, he could definitely donate funds to help fix Flint's problem.

A followup tweet said ""reply to my tweet with ppm & ppb test results & will send someone to install a water filter."" I'm assuming that means higher grade filters than what the govt had been providing.

3220,Nekosom,http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/elon-musk-pledges-to-fund-fixing-water-in-flint-homes-contaminated-above-fda-levels,"So, may be a little late to this one, but just thought I'd speak on this as a Flint resident.  There was a certain point at which any attention given to this issue was welcome, because we as residents of the city were screaming that something was wrong, and no one would listen to us.  Without the public figures that brought attention to this issue, we probably would still be suffering through the worst of it.

But while I appreciate Elon Musk's desire to help, I really wish he wouldn't have brought it up unless he had some concrete plan.  Because we have the water filters, the bottled water (though not from the state, mind you), and the attention.  The situation now is considerably more complicated, and the attention being drawn to the issue has become more a hindrance than a help.  Like most victims, we want to move on with our lives, and most of us really dislike being defined by this crisis.  Unless he plans on funding pipe replacement (I won't dismiss that possibility), there's really not much for him to do.  I *suppose* his company could help install new technologies at our water treatment facility, as many of the issues residents have with the water right now likely have to do with the chemicals treating it.  Again though, I don't know what different could be done, nor do I think he's given it much thought at this point.

I'm not going to bag on the guy for offering to help.  Nor will I blame him for the sideshow his comments will invite.  But honestly, when Elon Musk offers to help me and my fellow Flint residents, my first reaction is ""No thanks.""  Maybe that will change, but I'm honestly already dreading the headlines the next days and weeks will bring because of those comments.",news,t2_jl7ph4h,8y4eg8,e28qqbb,/r/news/comments/8y4eg8/elon_musk_pledges_to_fix_flint_mi_water_problem/e28qqbb/,/r/news/comments/8y4eg8/elon_musk_pledges_to_fix_flint_mi_water_problem/

3323,JuxtaposedSalmon,http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/elon-musk-pledges-to-fund-fixing-water-in-flint-homes-contaminated-above-fda-levels,"I think the big issue in Flint is that they installed all the water filters that make the water acceptable to FDA standards. That's why they said they'd stop the water distribution.

The problem is that the people saying the water is safe are the people who lied in the first place and caused the whole mess.  I wouldn't believe them either.  And I wouldnt want to depend on a water filter alone to keep me safe.

Replacing the pipes is expensive and time consuming. If there was more political will to get it done, it wouldnt be a problem.  The problem is the lack of will and organizational ability to get this big problem fixed. It's the same situation in Puerto Rico. Millions of dollars are getting spent, but there are a lot of shady contractors and for profit businesses and corrupt politicians greasing their palms along the way.

So sure, Musk is saying that he'll fix the water un houses that test above FDA levels.  Supposedly they've done that, and if I were a resident of Flint, I'd be testing my water frequently. Heck, most of us should probably get our water tested.

The bigger issue is that we don't trust our institutions. And we don't feel like our money is being spent wisely when there are big catastrophes. Elon Musk replacing a few filters isn't going to make our system better.",news,t2_jl7ph4h,8y4eg8,e28o5l6,/r/news/comments/8y4eg8/elon_musk_pledges_to_fix_flint_mi_water_problem/e28o5l6/,/r/news/comments/8y4eg8/elon_musk_pledges_to_fix_flint_mi_water_problem/

I've seen everything from some ""some rich dude who wants to show off how wealthy he is"" to ""our government institutions should be handling this and we should elect qualified leaders""

Well, here's the rub. You fucking didn't. You lazy ass morons sat on your fucking asses and didn't bother to vote or you voted for corrupt asshats who ended up fucking you in the ass. And it's not like you did it just once and learned your lesson. You fuckin twats have been bamboozled by the upper echelons of power for so long, you actually admire and worship the system that's responsible for fucking you over and ripping you off.

Along comes a guy who actually did something with his life, followed his dreams and got lucky enough and was smart enough to actually make it and retains some sense of his humanity. How do people respond? By shitting all over his efforts to contribute to society and fix your fuckups.

This post will be voted down to hell by the same morons who are so utterly jealous of anyone more accomplished than they. You know what this says to me? In America it's ok to dream the American dream, but don't you dare actually fucking achieve it. As Americans we're such petty little unimaginative greedy bastards that we'll do everything we can to drag someone back down to our ranks. 

I couldn't give two shits about Tesla, Musk or SpaceX. I think it's nifty that they're working to further mankind's reach into space and attempting to provide cutting edge technological solutions to some of our energy problems, but I don't think Musk is some kind of new age Nikola Tesla.

What sickens me is this group think attitude of tearing someone down simply because their success reminds you of your failures. A lot of Americans don't deserve what's coming down the pipe in the next few years but a whole lot of you do. The next time you're shouting about the government fucking you over and corporations raping your livelihood on a daily basis and are looking for someone to blame.....try looking in the mirror.",news,t2_jl7ph4h,8y4eg8,e28zj0v,/r/news/comments/8y4eg8/elon_musk_pledges_to_fix_flint_mi_water_problem/e28zj0v/,/r/news/comments/8y4eg8/elon_musk_pledges_to_fix_flint_mi_water_problem/

3609,ABetterKamahl1234,http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/elon-musk-pledges-to-fund-fixing-water-in-flint-homes-contaminated-above-fda-levels,"Thing is, things are being done in Flint to fix it, but like any city-wide infrastructure replacement, shit takes time and costs a fuckload. 

It's not like Flint is still ignoring everything, pipes are being replaced and have been for a while now. 

Even if Musk pours a shitload of money on the problem itself, it doesn't really speed up the process without directly hiring a large army of workers to do it. It's not anything close to a small task. 


All of this on top of the fact that if people really cared about water safety for towns and cities, the 3100+ worse towns in the US would get looked at first. Think about this, there's places measuring 4x worse levels than Flint, and they're being ignored. 


And heck, while he had good intentions, he didn't actually do anything. Something I find rather characteristic of his personality is that officials who were working on saving the boys informed him that his, while well thought out and advanced solution, would not be usable for the mission at hand. It seems a fair bit like there wasn't much faith in the teams that his solution would be worthwhile, or at the very least that Musk's teams didn't discuss the solution well enough to determine usability of it. His plan to even ensure that it wouldn't get stuck was to use an inflatable version before using the real sub, which I find to be likely unreliable as it'd not pose the same form as a rigid tub in terms of ensuring it won't get stuck. An inflatable tube scraping in a tight tunnel is less likely to get stuck than a rigid metal tube. 

Note, this isn't saying his intent in efforts would go unappreciated, but that it seems while he's a problem solver, he tries to tackle all problems his own way rather than thinking about what works best. In some situations you can't rapidly implement a solution that's highly advanced and use it with the reliability needed, as was evidenced by the lack of usage of the ""submarine"". 

Even if it wasn't PR seeking, it was catering to his fans which is a form of PR. His involvement came from a request by one of his fans, which denying it was only spelling negative PR. None of his fans would believe him if he stated that he felt that Thailand called on the most skilled and experienced rescuers they could find and had confidence in their success. As mentioned the risk of say the submarine getting stuck is something simply too great to go with,  as the narrowest of the sections was challenging enough for the divers already. This isn't to say his solution could never work, but it's too rushed to work in the emergency scenario that was present with enough reliability to risk usage. Nobody wants to place the life of someone they're rescuing in a largely untested piece of equipment, that's foolish and potentially deadly.

Not really, anyways. He helps, sure, but he doesn't *fix the problem*.

It doesn't help that the media plays into this and writes ""MUSK FIXES PROBLEM!"" when he just basically says he wants to help on twitter or something. But then again, maybe don't do that because that's how the media works and will continue to work.

How about he *first* does what he can to help, and *then* announce on twitter that he did that? Instead of doing it the other way around, resulting in the usual news articles before anything even has been done.

A cynical person would say that he's doing this on purpose, knowing that the *announcement* of help is much easier to generate headlines with his name in them than *actually helping*.

More specifically to this issue - my understanding is that the biggest hindrance to finding a solution is money. Elon's greatest asset here isn't so much engineering capability (strong as that is) but in building an unorthodox business case that makes resolving the issue profitable - something no-one else has done yet.

But I understand why some people don't like him. Some are unreasonable and just don't like him because they can. But others distrust him. He's known for being an amazing salesman, but that hasn't always resulted in... anything at all. He raises a lot of capital for things with long term payoffs if any, so his ventures can be risky. And some of them have just been bad. That's understandable, no one is perfect. But he's also done some really shady stuff. He's been accused or sued several times by employees claiming he won't pay people. Why? I'm not sure. Maybe cash flow problems, maybe to hide that a company is struggling, maybe some other reason. Most people are like me, we haven't read into it enough and just know he's accused of stiffing his workers.

He backs things I would like to see backed often. But I don't like all his ideas, all the ventures he does, or all the decisions he makes. I do believe he is very intelligent, but I think it's his charisma that's made him such a big player. So, I like him.

In a way it allows our democratic institutions off the hook for their negligence and shifts our expectations and dependencies as a society toward concentrated, unaccountable , private capital instead of what should be our accountable and public institutions.

3687,zeidrich,http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/elon-musk-pledges-to-fund-fixing-water-in-flint-homes-contaminated-above-fda-levels,"But I don't think that Musk is blowing this out of proportion. 

His response wasn't ""I'm going to give millions of dollars"" or ""I plan to push the reset button on all the work that's already been done."" 

His response was just ""Ok, if you're still in a house that has contamination above FDA levels, send me your test results and I will have someone install a filter, and I'll speak with the Mayor see if I can help.""

I don't think this is so much trying to capitalize on government distrust.  This is trying to help with a problem.  Even if 97% of homes are below the EPA compliance level, that means that 3% or about 3000 people are still drinking contaminated water.  If this is the case then it's a big deal for those 3000 people, and it's a relatively trivial problem for someone with a net worth of $20 billion to fix. 

Yeah, he does get something from it.  But it doesn't cost anything of anyone.  

If I was one of those 3% of houses that still had contaminated water, and the government currently had repairs underway but even so my house still had contaminated water, and someone said ""Hey, if that's the case, that sucks, and I'm willing to help you out."" then fuck yeah, I'm going to take him up on the offer. 

Sure, the EPA has financed repairs, sure the government is correcting the issues.  But if it's not 100% then people are still impacted, and if someone wants to help those people then don't you fucking throw up some moral outrage over that fact. 

If there's nobody actually affected, then great, he doesn't have to do anything. It will be like the Thai submarine that wasn't used. It was intended to help, it didn't get used, he still put some effort forward and stood behind his commitment.  It wasn't to make a buck, it was just meant to help out, even when he wasn't asked.  You can't necessarily do good everywhere, but you might as well do it where you can, and high profile things are more noticeable and garner more support. 

If he were interfering with the ongoing efforts or even outright criticising the current repair efforts I would agree with you.  But that's not the case, he's just saying ""If you have poisonous water, show me a test that says that and I will get someone to give you a filter that will make your water less poisonous.""",news,t2_jl7ph4h,8y4eg8,e29z725,/r/news/comments/8y4eg8/elon_musk_pledges_to_fix_flint_mi_water_problem/e29z725/,/r/news/comments/8y4eg8/elon_musk_pledges_to_fix_flint_mi_water_problem/

That is absolutely false.  Home plumbing has copper pipes, copper pipes are totally fine.

It's the lead and galvanized lead service lines that connect homes to the water mains.  THOSE have already been replaced, all 6000 of them.  That's why the current lead levels are now well below the federal threshold and they cut off the bottled water supplies because they don't actually need them anymore.

4221,gaxio,http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/elon-musk-pledges-to-fund-fixing-water-in-flint-homes-contaminated-above-fda-levels,"They broke the entire water system for the city.  The old lead and iron pipes were fine until they decided to switch to a cheaper water source from the river which was more acidic corroded the pipes.  They rushed through a cost-cutting measure without understanding the implications of it and completely fucked their water infrastructure and there's no easy fix for that.

The really sad thing is that this was an entirely foreseeable outcome.  However, because Flint was using so-called ""emergency managers"" to try to fix the budget for the city (which was way, way in the red), they weren't held to the same standard.  They had the power to push through these changes legally without engineering reports and tests and it went really, really badly.

So it's not about who can pony up a few million dollars to fix the problem, it's about who can pony up the considerable sum to more or less replace all the water mains in the city.  Note that Flint has no money, and a lot of people don't see a point in replacing water mains to dying communities that look like a war zone and are mostly abandoned buildings and houses.

And in part I don't either, no one in charge is willing to drop the hammer and admit that they need to downsize the city (if that could even be done).  Part of the reason why they can't police the city is because of its size and the fire department hates the abandoned buildings all over the place.  It sucks and there's no easy solution, and I don't think Musk's help is going to do all that much either.  He means well, but the problems here are so much deeper than them needing some cash to fix their water system.",news,t2_jl7ph4h,8y4eg8,e28g0n0,/r/news/comments/8y4eg8/elon_musk_pledges_to_fix_flint_mi_water_problem/e28g0n0/,/r/news/comments/8y4eg8/elon_musk_pledges_to_fix_flint_mi_water_problem/

I pointed out that this is unfalsifiable since you can claim ANY positive or neutral interaction with the public was some kind of PR move.

You also wouldn't see the typical, organic interactions that these people have. Those interactions typically aren't recorded.

Who gives a shit if Musk is doing something partly for PR? What are the impacts of his actions and plans? Is his plan feasible or is it batshit insane (as some of his plans are)?

Approaching him this way has given me a fairly positive view. Certainly FAR better than my opinion most people of that level of wealth.

Makes a post every year on the anniversary of his death about missing a wonderful man or blah blah blah. Defends the Apple stylus by leaping through a ton of hoops in his mind to not make it at odds with Steve's dogma.

I mean, Jobs might as well have been a deity to him.

I haven't seen anyone come even close to that sort of rabid fanboyism for Musk. But again, I'm willing to admit that maybe I just have to look more.

The guy is a billionaire, he makes big money, he acts like Tony Stark, he's kind of an asshole, many of his employees have lodged credible complaints about their work environment and his behavior. All these things are true.

He also said he'd eliminate gasoline and look at that. He'd pick up the spaceflight slack, there's money in it anyway, we should never have stopped, look a rocket ship! The hyperloop sounds like a really good idea. He's gonna build it. No, really, he's gonna build it, it's gonna work.

It works!

They built that kid submarine in like four days. Mock it, if you like, because they didn't end up using it, but nobody expected them to go before it was done. They decided to go sort of abruptly, because it didn't rain, and the submarine thing wasn't ready until a few hours after that.

Fine. They saw a problem, they devised a problem using *a part from one of their rocket ships* like fucking NASA when there's an emergency in space, and they built it in a few days, and there was absolutely no money in it.

One, I think if WalMart or Budweiser had figure heads as popular as Elon then they'd be using them as well. A similar case might be the Founder/CEO(?) of Papa Johns who steps out on occasion and makes some statements.

The other way is that this might be a divide between old gen vs new gen think. The corp PR statement is something that has happened for decades and will probably continue to happen, but I think a lot of companies are also seeing the benefit of utilizing social media as a platform to put out PRs as well since they have a lot more control over how the message delivery happens. Compare it to previous generation, where a business puts out a PR and then they have to rely on news outlets to digest and disseminate the message.  

Finally, there is the ""Elon is a narcissist,"" which as somewhat of a Elon Fanboy, I'm willing to admit is probably true, hell I think he admitted to that possibility as well in a recent tweet.

Flint got screwed because the great automotive captains of industry there monopolized the local economy and employed everyone, then outsourced when they could no longer make money off of them.  They have been getting shit on ever since, and no improvements were made to their infrastructure.
Tesla is a public company that makes automobiles.  Corporations have not been good for communities like Flint, Michigan. The irony here is not lost on me and it shouldn’t be on you, either.

What people here seem to not realize is that it was the ineptitude of the local government that lead to the crisis.

But at least for me, I see the people that take a kernel of truth and lie about all the context and purposely misrepresent it in a way that fits what they agree with as the same if not worse than those made up stories. Because someone can take a made up story with no truth and show someone else that and there isn't really a defense. But someone can take bad journalism and show it, and the other person can say, but look here it isn't all true, maybe its just exaggerated a bit. Even if 99% of the story is a lie people will try to defend the storyline.

That being said this story is not a big deal in terms of misleading, but there have been so many nefariously and purposefully deceitful articles that reach the top of reddit that are very much fake news in terms of claiming to say something that is the opposite of the truth, and I see people defend them as, well its just poor journalism, not fake.

And it was actually built, and tested. I can't remember if it was shipped out or not. And yeah, the chances of it being used were fairly low, considering they had navy seals there who were already escorting kids out, one at a time.

But what if a kid got sick, or fell unconscious? Submarine might have been useful in that kind of situation. And given how long they were in that cave, it was not a far fetched scenario.

So the submarine didn't get used. Oh well. That doesn't mean that Elon did nothing. Because that submarine, while not the preferred method of rescuing a kid, at least gave them more options and a backup plan.

> morons are salivating over him and acting like he personally rescued those Thai kids

Yeah, that's not what I'm saying. Those Thai navy seals are the ones who rescued the kids. But you think they did it alone? Those seals are just the tip of the spear, they had a support staff probably 20 times their number working with them directly, providing equipment, food, shelter, electricity, medical, etc. There was a separate engineering team that was pumping water as fast as they could. They're all heroes too. What about the friends and family that provided support to the parents? Because they were probably going through hell too.

This was a HUGE effort, for Thailand. And it was a focal event for the entire world to get behind. The entire WORLD breathed a sigh of relief when that last person was rescued. And the entire WORLD mourns the hero who lost his life during the rescue efforts.

You want to bash Elon for not being there personally, maybe? Are you mad at him for not PERSONALLY putting on scuba equipment and pulling a kid out of that cave? Are you pissed off because he built a rescue submersible and it wasn't used because they had managed to rescue those boys before it could get there?

Elon did what he could in his area of expertise. And the submersible wasn't used this time around. But if another tragedy strikes, then maybe it might prove useful then. I hope that tragedy never comes, but we all know this will happen again some day.

4863,GyantSpyder,http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/elon-musk-pledges-to-fund-fixing-water-in-flint-homes-contaminated-above-fda-levels,"A lot of them are probably quite young. A lot of reddit is a lot younger than people think. The whole men's rights thing, for example, has been mostly driven by teenagers and college students for most of its existence. College students tend to live on their own and not mix as much with older people. And in real life you can generally dismiss teenagers as doing their own thing on a different sort of level of engagement with the world and themselves than you, while on the internet there isn't that separation in who you're talking to between what you consider children and what you consider adults.

Also if you have 100 people on reddit regularly posting they can appear like an army, especially if they're backed by multiple accounts and bots, but they might be scattered hundreds of thousands of miles away from each other. In real life they're a drop in the bucket.

Social media, including reddit, twists people's perception of the world pretty severely. We can't really comprehend social groups on the scale of the actual population - our brains aren't made for it. So everybody to one extent or another ""Save By the Bells"" the world -- picks who they think the major characters are, and assumes they are everyone important and do everything important. And some people are better at grabbing that role in people's minds than others. And it's why four random jackoffs saying something rude on Twitter suddenly turns into a dozen thinkpieces by two TV networks and ten blogs about a definitive trend and public attitude.

It's also how Trump won the presidency - by inserting himself as the Zack Morris in the shrunken political worlds of a whole hell of a lot of people by maintaining their constant attention.

There's real power in it, so thinking people have a responsibility not to just passively accept the provocative lies of jackoffs. But that sends us back into the cycle of paying attention to these people.

If Musk can help Flint, that's wonderful, and I applaud him for that. But he doesn't actually have a very good track record of getting things done as promised, between Tesla production issues on the business side and the totally impractical sub-tube from Thailand. And unlike Bill and Melinda Gates, who use their clout to generate PR about their charity work, Musk is using his charity work to generate PR about himself and his companies; the PR incentives are totally reversed.

I don't think that Musk didn't want to help in Thailand, or anything so overly cynical, but I think that he absolutely leapt in to generate PR as ""a real life Tony Stark"", to quote Reddit threads, and vastly overstated the likelihood of his project being useful in order to generate additional news cycles for himself. I don't think it actively harmed the rescue effort, but it didn't really help.

I hope Flint's not the same way; at minimum, it's not actually a challenge Musk can publicly ""engineer"" a solution to, so as long as he puts up a bunch of money he'll make a difference, and that's great.

You're praising him for mundane things that are ultimately decisions made for his benefit, and he specifically does things for his benefit.

If he actually cared about doing good he would do the good the best way possible. Having SpaceX building a submarine that is completely useless is far less useful than literally just giving money to the cause if needed, or even contacting people that could possibly help more.

Its like ya he did ""good"" but its incredibly easy to do far better, meaning he isn't actually doing it for the good of it, he is doing it for PR. Imagine if you came home with a C average grade and your parents were like ""well at least you passed, thats good right!?""
