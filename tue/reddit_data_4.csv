He shoots down ideas he knows are dangerous because of his engineering knowledge, like when joe rogan suggest magnetic roads and he says it wouldn't be feasible, and is really aware of the potential danger's of his boring company's tunnels with regards to gas being trapped in there, earthquakes, etc. The reality of mysteries is infinitely more boring than our expectation of it. This will be a good thing for increasing our ability to invent things to advance medicine and science and shit like that rather than something that will be our extinction or lead to some Black Mirror shit. 

People will use it to do fucked up shit, and it probably wont work right but if we are real careful it could be awesome. another thing is that i think that if you had instant access to the wealth of knowledge that exists online with the speed of our fastest processors you wouldn't be motivated to be violent if you could invent something incredible or cure cancer, or more realistically calculate things instantly and learn things instantaneously which in turn will make doing things like science and math and engineering infinitely more convenient.

You can't replicate something you can't directly communicate with. This is the way that we don't just learn to interface, we learn to improve upon. Being bound by these sacks of protein means we'll never see new worlds. We aren't cut out for space travel. It's why I think the thought that aliens would physically visit is bullshit.

Now can it be considered evolution if it's by design? It's quite different than say, a bird having a different colored beak on a particular island for whatever reason. But I'd say ya. At a certain point we're responsible for our own existence. Proteins are no different than silicon. Nature just used what it had available to kick start life. It had some goo, the sun, and a shit load of water. It's shortsighted to think that we are the products of perfect design. We aren't, we were built by an efficient use of what was available. It worked great, but it's limits are dependant on a really long time scale and many, many, many generations of short lived iterations. Its only recently that knowledge an individual attained is retained in any real way. How much is lost though? How much has to be relearned by the next generation? How many times has progress been stopped because no one was around to be an apprentice for some brilliant life.

Fuck that shit. Hook me up, turn that shit on reverse mode and upload me. If the choice is be squishy and die, or become an abstraction that can exist for as long as it wants, I'll take the latter.

Fairly ordinary kind of integrated circuit could detect the electric field caused by an activated axon. If we use common size for camera pixels, 1 µm / micron / micrometer, one signal arriving at axon's end would cause electric field detection on multiple pixels near and around it. If a nerve bundle has 10 million axons, then a consumer grade integrated circuit chip could easily have 100 million electric field detection pixels / cells, in order to have on average ten pixels per axon. Pixel width could be half micron if needed and it would still be much bigger and bulkier than parts in chips for usb-sticks, ram memory or CPUs. Common consumer grade tiny SD-cards have much more than 100 million parts. Nerve signals were first measured with 1930s technology, one at a time. Chips can do it millions at a time, 200 frames per second if needed ( although 10 FPS might be good ). Flash eeprom non-volatile memory is based on electric field detection. A firing axon end has much larger electric charge than one bit in a usb-stick.

Output chip that causes axon activations would be about same level of difficulty. To precisely cause any one particular axon to activate, the output chip would need to have electric field detectors too so that after it's own electric field has risen and fallen on some set of output pixels, it can measure which axons got activated as a result. This information then enables adjusting the set of output pixels that must be set to activated state in order to trigger a signal in a particular axon and only in that axon.

The number of pixels needs to be larger than the number of axons in the nerve bundle because wires can not be assigned one by one to every axon ( at least not with common chip technology ). Instead the assignment has to happen in software inside a special computer. Every axon end that touches the sensor chip / input chip flat surface ends up having a set of pixels assigned to it when the configuration is done. Maybe just one pixel's state indicates reliably when a particular axon is activated, if that one pixel is well chosen by the configuration software. Maybe for some axons there needs to be some kind of ""voting logic"" so that for example 3 out of 7 pixels next to the axon need to report electric field detection in order to count that axon as active.

Information about active axons during a time frame is transmitted to the output-side, either as a bitmap with 1 indicating active and 0 inactive or as a list of assigned codes. Then that list can be used for retransmitting axon signals.",TechNewsToday,t2_3qt99,ce7fq0,eu3g12t,/r/TechNewsToday/comments/ce7fq0/elon_musk_unveils_neuralinks_plans_for/eu3g12t/,/r/TechNewsToday/comments/ce7fq0/elon_musk_unveils_neuralinks_plans_for/

More specifically Musk isn't just wiring into peoples brains, he's building on existing technology and making it safer. the first users will be paraplegics too, so it's not purely a selfish endeavor. the goal being that they can make use of their limbs somehow through taking the information and electrical signals from their brain and bypassing the broken connection, and giving the direction directly to their muscles.

1. We can't grow brains just yet. We don't have that kind of technology.

2. We could do that, but for every rat we save there are millions of animals an lifeforms we destroy for our gain. Every day species go extinct because of us. We destroy their environment just for our benefit, in some cases even our presence. So this task is impossible, unless we reduce our own population.

He's said some crazy shit for sure, but he's not perfect and i think he's aware of that. he hasn't necessarily done anything crazy just has crazy ideas. 

he's open about his opinions but more importantly then open to criticism. at least i think he's more open to criticism than he is adverse to it. he's not a politician, so it's kind of harder for him to bullshit the people in his community i feel like, not impossible just harder. 

Honestly, im just excited about the implications of all the technology he's advancing, but i actually think it does outweigh the downsides.  The danger is less of a concern when you realize shit that you and i haven't considered as harmful or invasive, Elon and others are working on and sharing info ab right now. like the concern of advertising companies using data directly from our brains to manipulate us further into making decisions that aren't our own. 

p.s. kind of a shower thought but thought it was intresting, what if elon is going to be the first human born AI. like he says the neuralink technology is his solution to his concerns about AI, so that we can 'upload' ourselves digitally to the internet and be symbiotic with AI. then he will either destroy us or leave us by his logic right? the neuralink tech is starting with paraplegics so maybe people with Alzheimer's or those in comas will be the first people they test it on. some black mirror shit haha",TechNewsToday,t2_3qt99,ce7fq0,eu2sje9,/r/TechNewsToday/comments/ce7fq0/elon_musk_unveils_neuralinks_plans_for/eu2sje9/,/r/TechNewsToday/comments/ce7fq0/elon_musk_unveils_neuralinks_plans_for/

(your microwave is a faraday cage though, so it won’t harm you). even the article you link keeps mentioning ‘energy’. RF is measured in frequency (Hz) and energy (Amps). frequency in the RF spectrum, as best as modern science can tell, doesn’t harm anyone. but if you crank the Amps up you will literally begin to cook! high Amperage RF is very harmful to the eyes and testes. if you ever have a job around high Amp transmitters there are safety precautions out the ass so no one gets injured. the reason cell phones don’t harm the testes is because they don’t transmit at nearly high enough Amps. anyway, i’m not trying to pick an internet fight, nor am i trying to condescend you. you are right that RF isn’t some evil cancer causing death ray, but it does have risks associated with it too. anyway, take it easy!",TechNewsToday,t2_3qt99,ce7fq0,eu3nimv,/r/TechNewsToday/comments/ce7fq0/elon_musk_unveils_neuralinks_plans_for/eu3nimv/,/r/TechNewsToday/comments/ce7fq0/elon_musk_unveils_neuralinks_plans_for/

You can measure brain waves when your brain is active, also known as thinking. 
But you can’t just think random shit and the interface knows what to do. It needs to be trained some how. If you’re in a wheel chair and want to go forward you have to think of a very specific image so that the recorded brain wave is the same every time. Otherwise the controller doesn’t know what to do with the input. 
If you want to google something with your mind, obviously the controller needs to exactly know what you want to know. So I don’t see how you DON‘T get that your thoughts are being read. 
It’s the same with voice recognition in Alexa. Sure, you can believe that only the stuff you say after „Alexa“ is being recorded or you just google and find out that everything that can be abused, will be abused.

Not just words alone, if you're adamant about following a strict rule without question , then how do you know if that is the right way for others? Relatively speaking what I'd say is to know about what your actions entail - and overall perhaps what the situation is with anyone else. 

There can be enough food to feed everyone on this planet, the problem is the lack of a reliable supply of food, that is guaranteed and available to everyone.

For example,  say a specific algae hydroponics that sustainably produce food that humans and perhaps other similar organisms can utilize. Hydroponics which can be integrated within each building and thus can supply each individual with food. There can even be designated buildings for such tasks as well. Doesn't have to be algae alone, but there can be any plant and non animal of sorts, openly available to just walk up to and receive freely. Overall make sure that everyone can absolutely have access to food.

Automating such a process can require minimal maintenance if built to last. And even so, to everyone that want's to utilize said machinery, then keeping it together would be of their interests. And even so could be beneficial to others. If you know of something important, and want to keep the knowledge around, then making sure it can be preserved is a way to do it.

You are your body and your mind. It’s already connected. You don’t have to think about moving your arm for it to move. But the interface between your brain and some electronic device needs to know what you want it to do. So it has to read your mind. 
If it’s just moving an arm than maybe it’s possible to intercept that brain wave that sends the signal to your arm. A few years ago the tech couldn’t register those waves because they were to small. Maybe this works now. But that would only work if your brain is wired to your limbs. You need to know how to move your arm, so to speak.

In the current global political and societal climate a belief such as yours is imo far less widespread and even if, there is no unity regarding the method we should use to combat those big global problems, like hunger, war, etc.

  
That's what I meant. This is the utopia. The technology you could use is irrelevant (as I said, to think of a solution is easy). The problem is, far to few people would follow your ethic code.  
We have people on this planet, that would rather go to war, than give up eating meat. We have people, that don't care about animals or even humans that don't have the some skin color as them.   


You're thinking like in german I would say a ""Volkswirtschaftler"". I think it translates mostly to economics major. I say that, because they tend to view the world like a giant machine and if you pull the right lever, then everything falls into place automatically. Like establishing a ""algae station"" would somehow lead to widespread use of this technology and solve this problem.

I think there is a very popular idea that AI is something that is going to “surpass humans” and somehow achieve a human likeness. IMO this is fear mongering and any claims that computers can become like humans or smarter with AI is not truthful.

The term AI is itself misleading: while there are algorithms that perform unsupervised learning, these neural networks are still only doing what we tell them to do, and most applications of “AI” are so problem specific and are only useful in the scope of the problem being solved. Again: computers do what humans tell them to do, NO MORE, NO LESS. I think AI as a tool is extremely useful and a great way to understand various physical phenomena, including the brain, so I like what Elon has done here.

But here’s the problem: when you exit the tunnel you are back into gridlock.  That means traffic is going to back up into the tunnel and you’ll have the same gridlock there as you do above ground.  Basically this is going to have to be an expensive toll road to keep the volume of drivers down so the speeds stay high.  

Then throw in the fact that you need an elevator to get you car in and out?   That isn’t going to be fast.

Let’s start with this:  This is a sewer tunnel that was created by a typical sewer TBM and is chock full of potential single points of failure and major capacity limitations in the design.

The bore size, elevator capacity, single tracking, lack of emergency systems/exit paths, and relying on individual vehicle systems for propulsion are all very serious problems.

I have some respect for what Musk is doing with Tesla and Space X.  In the case of this and Hyperloop he is a full bore (pun intentional) charlatan. 

Here is a detailed takedown of why Musk’s claims about this tunnel and its systems and entirely non-credible.  Enjoy.

What about earthquakes?
Tunnels, when designed properly, are some of the safest places to be during an earthquake. From a structural safety standpoint, the tunnel moves uniformly with the ground, in contrast to surface structures.  Additionally, a large amount of earthquake damage is caused by falling debris, which does not apply inside tunnels. Some examples:

1994 Northridge Earthquake: no damage to LA Subway tunnels

There are instances where large explosions have set off seismometers, but those are few and far between. The state of California has a significant amount of tectonic movement due to stress release of fault lines crossing the majority of it.

Plate tectonics are pretty fascinating. Depending on the direction the plate is moving, as well as the pressures between fault lines, there are a few different types of movement you can get. If it’s a powerful enough movement for long enough, you can even start to get liquefaction of the soil, which would defeat even the best of earthquake structural engineering, as most of it has to do with essentially creating a safety buffer between the structure and the surrounding soil/foundation.

Additionally, inside the city I would make use of their fast and smaller tunnels for an electric bike / electric motorcycle / electric scooter that would give people a safe place to use smaller vehicles to cross big stretches of land. 

If we could get more people that single-ride onto smaller electric vehicles and off the roads in the form of SUV's, and remove the trucks from the freeways, you'd be able to do things like double up carpool / bus lanes, and then the existing freeway network along with the planned expansions of Metro's Light Rail network would actually support the huge ass population that lives here.

441,theRealDerekWalker,https://techxplore.com/news/2018-12-elon-musk-unveils-underground-tunnel.html,"That comment is over 190 days old. Tesla now makes a profit and is producing over 7000 cars/week, as Musk forecasted. A lot of this info is skepticism which today has been proven wrong. 

You need to understand something - the automobile industry was seen in the business world as almost impossible to penetrate. Electric cars, before Tesla, were not seen as a viable product line, even for established manufacturers (watch “Who Killed the Electric Car?”)

Musk not only broke into the car industry, but did it while going with an all-electric car. That’s fucking bananas, but this guy did it, and made it into what is today a profitable business. This alone should give people an enormous amount of respect for this guy.

Beyond this, he went from the CEO of another extremely successful company, PayPal, to building fucking rockets. You know, the things that NASA even struggles to get right? Not only built them, but built them more economically feasible. He now is THE leader in that industry. Don’t tell me achieving that is not “rocket science.”

He has proven very smart people wrong very consistently. As much as you probably pat your own back for having the guile to find a comment from 190+ days ago that points to some skepticism about Musk, the fact you have to live with is that you will never come anywhere close to Elon in making a dent in humanity. I, instead, applaud the guy for having the balls to try. Even if his endeavors don’t end up a success, he has changed industries and the world forever.

The Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.

That Boring proposal is called the Dugout Loop High Speed Transportation Project. It would ferry game day fans from the subway lines of Vermont Avenue to the ballpark three miles away via ""a fleet of autonomous all-electric modified Tesla Model X platforms"" from Musk's automaker, Tesla, according to a city summary.

It has the support of L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti.

- noise - absent controls, sound at the ends of tunnels can be very disruptive to the surrounding area 
- vibration - houses and buildings at the entrances and above the tunnel may be subject to vibration as vehicles pass 
- emissions/air quality concerns - this should be obvious, as conventional vehicles will emit various gasses. Unclear how much of a concern this would be for this project. 
- hazardous materials - this varies based on the intended use of the project; hazardous freight is a potential risk to human health and the environment should it spill, a study would help assess those risks and consider potential risk reduction at the project planning level
- freight - similar analysis to all of the previous listed factors, but also consider that new infrastructure potentially encourages more freight to pass through, which potentially increases all of the above 
- construction/displacement of existing buildings - this should be obvious, tunnels take up space and may require the destruction of existing buildings and/or the creation of venting structures above the tunnel. 


The point of environmental assessments is not to require a specific outcome relative to the environment (at least, that's the case with NEPA, the federal law; I'm unfamiliar with how substantive the requirements of CEQA are). Instead, the studies allow the government in charge of permitting to figure out the actual risks, make those available to the public, and to THINK ABOUT (not even necessarily act, in some cases) alternatives that may have less impact or more tolerable risks to the environment. 

  The trade off is that the process takes time and money. ",TechNewsToday,t2_3qt99,a13nko,eamyspk,/r/TechNewsToday/comments/a13nko/elon_musks_la_freeway_tunnel_wont_see_the_light/eamyspk/,/r/TechNewsToday/comments/a13nko/elon_musks_la_freeway_tunnel_wont_see_the_light/

Because assuming they look at alternative routes and they then choose that instead, couldn’t the neighborhood association in that area file a similar suit demanding they then search for other routes that may be suitable, thus pushing off the start of a project indefinitely?

It happens when a business is in cahoots with the government or is a government run business. What I mean is, an institution will bribe the government (or in this case be government involved) in order to have the government perpetually investigate the rivals to the institution and instate unfair and outright idiotic regulations in order to overwhelm their rival and disrupt the business in hopes to cripple their rival 

But the US isn’t Romania. Romania is a socialist corrupt nightmare with more money in politics than in business, and NASA starting inane investigations into their rival’s holdings on bullshit grounds such as these is not something we should hope to hear in America.

Since when did NASA have the power to institute an investigation of a private company directly instead of say, the FBI, and since when a government monopoly doesn’t count as a monopoly is beyond me, but there is a clear ulterior motive to this investigation.

Tldr: NASA is pulling some 3rd world, corrupt bullshit in order to disrupt their rivals, and somebody needs to hold them accountable.",TechNewsToday,t2_4887t,9z3s1n,ea80wxw,/r/TechNewsToday/comments/9z3s1n/elon_musk_smoking_weed_sparks_nasa_investigation/ea80wxw/,/r/TechNewsToday/comments/9z3s1n/elon_musk_smoking_weed_sparks_nasa_investigation/

Also another documentary I remember watching but cant find again atm where an ex nasa employee goes to space x and was very concerned about the way space x went about things vs. nasa. 

He seemed to think that space x proceeded too quickly spending just days to tackle something. While nasa would spend weeks/ months making sure it was the right path to take.

It’s a rule that exists because the Putins of the world use blackmail as a standard everyday tool.  It’s rare when a spy is actually caught and right now there are people with security clearances sharing information.  Don’t be surprised that it’s happening, be surprised when one gets caught.

Except he didn’t do anything illegal. It’s semantics. You read it on a headline and you just repeat it. 

He acted out of “line” per se. hence there was a settlement. It doesn’t do the public good to hammer down every little mistake. 

He had talks about funding that much is true. For some their word is their word. The SEC just wanted it in writing or they don’t like him saying it anything about it. Hell the entire going public was still up to vote, didn’t get past that stage. 

Believe it or not but lay persons can become business owners and move on to CEO. They don’t have the full understanding of every single law and rule on the book. Any person really looking to invest will calculate these mistakes in. Every company pays some sort of settlement for a mistake.

Edit added the SEC language: 
“The total package of remedies and relief announced today are specifically designed to address the misconduct at issue by strengthening Tesla’s corporate governance and oversight in order to protect investors,” said Stephanie Avakian, Co-Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division.”

They see it as just misconduct not fraud, or illegal. He acted out of line for a CEO and a that’s part of why people like him, he’s not typical CEO.

That doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with production, it means they’re selling more than they can produce.

According to [Bloomberg ](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/) Tesla has been producing more cars this quarter than in any quarter of their history.  They’ve been consistently above 4K cars per week and will build $50K+ Model 3s this quarter.

If Tesla sells every one of those plus the 8K Model 3s they had in transit going into the quarter then I’d say that’s really great for business, and their stock.

Their transportation issues have been well documented for the last few months: https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-truck-trailers-20180926-story.html?outputType=amp

Add to this the actual article we’re commenting under shows that this change came from an interaction with Musk on Twitter where someone asked what would Tesla do if their orders didn’t arrive in time.  Tesla didn’t see a systemic problem and take action, someone asked a reasonable question and was given and reasonable answer.  Tesla will reimburse anyone with a pre-dec order who can’t take delivery before Dec-31.

They made a profit in q3 by pushing their numbers to what they said they would. Q4 is going to be even higher given production and demand was even greater. Propel don’t understand that Tesla does really have cars off the shelf, they’re configured based on orders and then delivered, so taking these orders now for cars they don’t have and giving the credit is giving customers exactly what they wanted, to the slight detriment of their share price. 

However when the q4 figures come out that share drop will be reversed and then some. The other factor is that Tesla is now generating significant profit while their production numbers are still relatively low - they’ve just passed their break even point and now the California tax deal came through where they’ve been given a massive break to retool for higher capacity (35k additional cars per year) production is only going soar.

Seeing as the folks there took whatever chance they had and ushered the kids out in the “simplest” way (as opposed to getting a bunch of steel tubes/sarcophagi through that tunnel) it seems Musk may have been overthinking it - never less both a good marketing ploy and possible idea for future aid missions. Ps. I’m not claiming to know better than anyone, just a thought I had - instead of reinventing the wheel he could’ve helped in other ways that weren’t reasonably impossible (fitting tubes into areas even humans wouldn’t fit)

Essentially, a public company has certain fiduciary responsibilities to you (the shareholder) and has a substantial burden of providing insight into how the overall organization is run.

A subsidiary, especially one like Boston dynamics, is not really beholden to SoftBank group shareholders like you. Ie, you don’t necessarily get insight into or control over Boston dynamics. Subsidiaries are distinct legal entities.

but that's not really what we were discussing. I don't mean to be overly pedantic, it's just that there is a significant difference between purchasing shares of a public company (SoftBank Group) vs a private subsidiary of that public company (Boston Dynamics).

Purchasing stakes in private companies / subsidiaries is very different from purchasing shares of public companies.

From the Hyperloop One website:

Our tubes are constructed out of thick, strong steel and are very difficult to puncture or buckle. We’re designing and constructing the tube and pods explicitly to handle down to 100 Pa of pressure or more (equivalent to air pressure at 200,000 feet above sea level), changes in air pressure, and to safely tolerate small leaks, holes, and even breaches without suffering from reduced structural integrity.

If there was a leak or breach in our tube in an operational system air would leak into the tube. The affected vehicles would slow down due to the additional air pressure, or require a power boost to get them to the next station. The pods will be built to withstand even sudden air pressure changes safely. We will also have the ability to section off parts of the route and re-pressurize sections in the case of a significant emergency. Every pod will have emergency exits if needed, but mostly pods will glide safely to the next portal (station) or egress point in the event of an emergency. Additionally, we are building sensors throughout the system to notify of any leaks or breaches and we would be able to identify and perform maintenance to resolve any leaks quickly.

I won't deny that is true.   It's also true that the UAW and most other unions have decreased efficiency and flexibility in an ever competitive world - costing millions of workers their jobs as entire industries move to other countries.  If unions were smart they'd get rid of some of their insane rules.  (example:  as CNC machines come into play they refused any contract that would let one machinist operate more than one machine at a time.  They wanted to read their newspaper while the machine ran its 4 hour program.  And they couldn't deburr or inspect parts during that time because that was a different job.  I witnessed this first hand so please don't pretend it didn't happen.  Yeah, that shop closed.)
  
I've never been part of a union but have worked with them.  The machine operators union (e.g. excavation) was pretty good.  You could get a trained operator for your bulldozer in a day's notice and they worked hard.  Usually they'd pick up a shovel if it helped the job get done.  The machinists union was just silly.  Seniority was the only thing that mattered; not talent or productivity.  Heaven forbid an engineer wiggle a thermocouple wire to see if it's loose: grievance.

>__Teledesic__ was a company founded in the 1990s to build a commercial [broadband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband) [satellite constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_constellation) for [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) services. Using [low-earth orbiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-earth_orbit) satellites small antennas could be used to provide uplinks of as much as 100 Mbit/second and downlinks of up to 720 Mbit/second. The original 1994 proposal was extremely ambitious, costing over [US$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar)9 billion and originally planning 840 active satellites with in-orbit spares at an altitude of 700 km.  In 1997, the plan was scaled back to 288 active satellites at 1400 km

For high bandwidth applications sats can be reasonable, but for streaming video, gaming, or anything else that requires less than a 2 second tx turn around between bursts, satellites aren't very helpful.

Sure, there can be artistic uses for something that is ""softer"" and arguably more intuitive but I really think that the majority of the time we want to get things in the right place quickly and that works best with granular or ""digital"" controls.

Multi-touch screens... another ""soft"" input method... were developed long before the iPhone. They stayed in R&D for the simple reason the they result was inferior to the mouse and keyboard. Not because of technological limitations but just because fat fingers aren't very precise. The only reason it gained popularity on phones is because other input methods are not physically available.

1773,Sidewinder77,http://allthingsd.com/20130918/elon-musk-is-building-a-self-driving-tesla/?refcat=news,"/u/PaulGodsmark commented yesterday in a [series of comments in r/SelfDrivingCars](http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/1mi7tq/tesla_motors_inc_seeking_to_hire_an_adas_controls/cc9jzru) that it's impossible for Tesla to build an AI good enough in 4-years to take on Google. The following is a compilation of his comments:

I am fairly confident that (Tesla) will just licence the Google Self driving Car (SDC) tech. There is no way on earth that Tesla can develop SDC tech on their own within 4 years - as the artificial intelligence, the key differentiator of this tech, is way too complicated for Tesla to be able to catch up with a company like Google. Who happen to have one of the most advanced AI research programs in the world. Any motivated undergrad course can now create a SDC, but it is an entirely different thing to make it 'intelligent' enough to travel safely on public roads. So what Tesla are doing is putting engineers in place that will facilitate the integration of the sensors and their inputs into the SDC AI 'brain' that probably Google will likely be providing to them. Given the relationships between Google and Tesla leaders and backers, and the proximity of their businesses in Silicon Valley, and the mutual respect for fully automated vehicles, then it would amaze me if Tesla don't align with the developer most likely to bring the SDC AI to market first - and that is very, very likely to be Google. These Tesla engineers will be ensuring that the cars they are designing look great, with the sensors incorporated in a way to enhance the car, and that the sensors are designed to function over the greatest range of climatic conditions possible.

Google have a team of at least 62 people - based on a photo included in one of their presentations early this year - so there are probably more now. Google have a fleet of probably at least 32 vehicles based on a survey of licence plates that we carried out on DriverlessCarHQ (FB page) earlier this year.

Tesla have now hired for three positions that I am aware of that relate to their fully automated vehicle program. A radar specialist, a camera/vision specialist and now this ADAS Controls Engineer position. The titles of the position do not include any reference to 'automated/autonomous/self-driving/driverless/etc.!' This latest job role says ""As an Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) Controls Engineer, you will be responsible for developing vehicle-level decision-making and lateral and longitudinal control strategies for Tesla’s effort to pioneer fully automated driving."" My interpretation is that ""vehicle-level decision-making"" is not AI development for understanding the external world, but ensuring that the output from the Artificial Intelligence Operating System (AIOS) is used appropriately for the vehicle to maintain control on the road.

There's a real disconnect with the recent Tesla ADAS Controls Engineer advert where they want to 'pioneer fully automated driving' and these statements from Musk talking about 90% of the driving task. There is a reason that Google want to leapfrog the NHTSA Level 3 automation, which requires the driver to be ready to take control as required. You end up needing even more sensors and intelligent systems inside the car to monitor the driver and ensure that he/she is up to taking over the driving task. But this is what Musk is aiming for. Yet Google have stated in April of this year that they have achieved 96,000 miles without safety critical human intervention. Google basically do have the makings of an early prototype Level 4 system (capable of unmanned operation) already. Musk is also a businessman, and is well aware that Level 4 automation means that he will sell less cars - and make less money. Hence the reticence of all of the automakers (thus far!!) to align with Google and licence their tech. Personally I wouldn't be surprised if this is a tactic to mis-lead the opposition whilst Google and Tesla plot in secret. When you read about some of the mis-direction games that Warren Buffet has played then you may agree that this could be what is happening here.

“My opinion is it’s a bridge too far to go to fully autonomous cars,” Mr Musk said in an interview with the Financial Times. “It’s incredibly hard to get the last few per cent.” What is funny about that comment, is that Ron Medford of Google (formerly 2nd-in-command at NHTSA) effectively answered Musk's statement in response to a question that I posed at the TRB Conference on Road Vehicle Automation. [Go to 14 mins 18 secs for my question and Ron's answer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMtz97GZtF8&list=PLfSgDJiYK20Sl1Fru_z-Ri9i2d0_Z3ZT1&index=8) where Ron says ""Someone asked us what our magic is, and the answer is; there's no magic, it's just very hard work"". So yes Google would seem to agree with Musk that it is very hard work - they just happen to have done a lot of that hard work already. Consider that Google have a team of over 62 people and probably 32 or more self-driving cars backed by possibly the best internal artificial intelligence research group in the world - and a $50bn cash pile to draw upon should they need it. Oh, and a 4 years head-start having cherry-picked some of the best competitors from the DARPA challenge. Of course Musk will be playing catch up in the 'hard work' stakes.

They divide the 1 billion into small units of a $1000 each, and set a 5 year deadline to gather the funds. Every person that wishes to contribute can sign up and own one ""unit"" of the initial project for $20 a month for 5 years. A small amount, but it adds up to around $1,000 over the course of the 5 years. Some people buy multiple units, some buy 1 unit. It all adds up.

They wait until the end of each year to determine how the funding will be allocated, and each unit carries a voting privilege with it: if you bought 10 units you have 10 votes, if you bought 1 unit, you have 1 vote, and so on. 

So not only are people contributing to the development of a project that will revolutionize how we travel, they are also involved in the decision making, and therefore the scale, of the project.

Here in Alaska we have the Permanent Fund Dividend, which is similar to UBI in that every citizen receives an annual check paid from the state's oil revenue, simply for living in Alaska. The amount fluctuates, but it usually increases every year due to inflation. Last year the PFD was capped at $1600 due to low oil prices, but also because the state’s government is funded by the same oil fund and not through taxation.

The PFD cap resulted in a far-right candidate winning the governorship in the last election, primarily because he vowed to raise the PFD amount to $3000. To pay for it he cut the state budget in half, which not only will result in the closure of one of the state’s three universities but over 2,000 jobs cut from the University of Alaska, major cuts to Medicare and the loss of nearly $2 billion in federal match funds.

If we don't have a president in place that cares about the overall needs of the people soon we will reach a point of no return..

1. There would be a small increase in prices but not nearly enough to offset the net gain from an extra $1000 a month. Additionally, business would be less inclined to jack up prices because a lot of the money is going to find its way back into their hands and the increase in consumer power would create increased competition. There will be a 10% VAT to draw funds particularly from tech companies like Amazon and Google.

2. UBI is opt in for people currently on social programs but it offers them an interesting new choice. UBI is no strings attached so they don’t have to worry about how they spend it or not appearing disabled enough so their benefits gets taken away. It will also be there for them when they elevate out of their current status and it is multiplied by however many adults are involved in a particular family. 

3. UBI is very pro-work. It puts real resources in worker’s hands to negotiate or relocate or take a shot on that business idea without feeling like they are going to starve if they do so. There is also an expectation of increased local activity in terms of non-profits, entrepreneurship and art as billions of new dollars begin flowing into local economies each month. 

4. Yang is not in favor of the $15 minimum wage because he doesn’t want to discourage hiring. He believes a UBI to be a much more impactful policy for business owners and workers, and with fewer drawbacks. 

5. UBI will help us save money on homeless services, emergency services, and many other retroactive programs that we spend massive amounts of money on currently. There is an expectation of happier, healthier, even smarter people as times become less scarce and people have more resources to address the issues in their personal lives, whatever those may be.

When you have primary services like internet access or health insurance, there are fewer providers so they can effectively coordinate price controls. You may see an increase in costs to those services. However, since they are primary, government intervention is more likely.

Most other consumer goods are produced by too many companies to affect market wide price controls, meaning  prices may shoot up for one product but there will usually be a company fighting to be the cheapest. 

As far as social programs go, a UBI is popular amongst progressives/liberals and conservatives/libertarians alike, making it politically viable. IF the left gets to keep social security and Medicare and the right gets to cut down on disability fraud. So you will likely see fewer disability claims.

Another argument supporting a UBI is that current welfare programs combined with employment standards keep people in poverty because they have to work two jobs to get the same amount of money.",politics,t2_414cr9wo,coneao,ewkxxkv,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/ewkxxkv/,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/

Traditional social welfare programs often have means testing, scrutinise or limit an individual's spending ability. This treats poor people like they are children, by not trusting them to spend the money on goods and services that they need. The counterargument is always going to be what about those people who will use the money to spend it on drugs and alcohol, there will always be people to abuse the system, but the vast majority of people just want to live with dignity, and treating the majority of welfare recipients like children to curb the inevitable bad behaviour of a small minority is wrong. It sidesteps society's warped thinking of needing poor people to jump through hoops, so that they earn their welfare, when the basis of the program is to live with some basic dignity. Furthermore if you eliminate traditional welfare programs, you don't need the bloated infrastructure to administer means testing, checking up on people, making food stamp arrangements etc you just need to send out a cheque.

The welfare program has a lot of useless fat coming from years of empty political promises. Hopefully a true UBI would make them obsolete.

As for inflation? Maybe, who knows. Will people spend more on unneeded products and artificially drive the price up? Yeah, probably in some places, but if we’re basing this on Keynesian economic models (which are faulted in some big ways but more or less hold up in the long run), people will also put their excess money into savings, investments, and so on, so that the money can recirculate into places to counter this. Or they’ll be able to meet certain mid-level needs (beyond simply not starving to death and having some place to live) that they weren’t able to before.

Ultimately, though, the sentiment boils down to the thought that if we’re all going to get fucked in the ass left, right and sideways, and we’re devolving into a late capitalist political hellscape, we may as well demand $1,000 a month for the pain and suffering.

2279,Calfzilla2000,https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-2020-election-endorsement-andrew-yang-president-2019-8,"UBI almost became a thing in the 1970's and it was important then. Look at all the statistics about the wealth gap in America. Mass automation and artificial intelligence makes it impossible to avoid but we still need it given the current circumstances. Generations are being squandered. We can't sit back and assume people will accept it when the job market collapses. We also can't assume that the true positive effects can be felt soon enough after tens of millions of people are unemployed.

You don't build a safety net after you jump. You build it before.

Here is what happened under Nixon. The basic income proposed was almost $12000 in 2019 dollars. Democrats killed it because it wasn't enough (HUGE mistake) and it delayed the proposal for decades.

> In 1970 it seemed that the time for a basic income had well and truly arrived.
> 
> With 243 votes for and 155 against, the House of Representative approved President Nixon’s Family Assistance Plan (FAP) on April 16, 1970. Most expected the plan to pass the Senate, too, which was even more progressive than the House.
> 
> But doubts from both sides of the aisle reared in the Senate Finance Committee. “This bill represents the most extensive, expensive, and expansive welfare legislation ever handled,” one Republican senator said.
> 
> Most vehemently opposed, however, were the Democrats. They felt the FAP didn’t go far enough, and pushed for an even higher income floor. The Senate and the White House batted the bill back and forth for months before finally giving up entirely.
> 
> The following year, Nixon presented a slightly tweaked proposal to Congress. Once again, the bill sailed through the House, now part of a larger reform package. (The vote this time was 288 in favor, 132 against.)
> 
> In his 1971 State of the Union address, Nixon declared that his plan to “place a floor under the income of every family with children in America” was the most important item on his legislative agenda.
> 
> But once again, the bill foundered in the Senate.
> 
> As the 1970s drew to a close the myth of Speenhamland became fodder for the Right once again. Conservative thinkers began lambasting the welfare state, using the same nineteenth-century arguments Nixon had inadvertently revived in his attempt to make basic income more palatable to his conservative constituency.

This is decades overdue and it will be too late if we wait till another election cycle to start addressing it, like Climate Change, which has done irreparable damage to the earth. Automation will do the same but to our people.

Know that r/basicincome doesn't represent Andrew Yang. I assume he has many supporters there but that isn't the purpose of that subreddit. We hang out over at r/YangForPresidentHQ if you want to get answers directly from Yang supporters. Anyway, this is Yang's plan to pay for it, from his [UBI FAQ page](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/):

>How would we pay for the Freedom Dividend?

>It would be easier than you might think. Andrew proposes funding the Freedom Dividend by consolidating some welfare programs and implementing a Value-Added Tax (VAT) of 10%. Current welfare and social program beneficiaries would be given a choice between their current benefits or $1,000 cash unconditionally – most would prefer cash with no restriction.

>A Value-Added Tax (VAT) is a tax on the production of goods or services a business produces. It is a fair tax and it makes it much harder for large corporations, who are experts at hiding profits and income, to avoid paying their fair share. A VAT is nothing new. 160 out of 193 countries in the world already have a Value-Added Tax or something similar, including all of Europe which has an average VAT of 20 percent.

>The means to pay for the Freedom Dividend will come from 4 sources:

>1.  Current spending.  We currently spend between $500 and $600 billion a year on welfare programs, food stamps, disability and the like.  This reduces the cost of the Freedom Dividend because people already receiving benefits would have a choice but would be ineligible to receive the full $1,000 in addition to current benefits.

>  Additionally, we currently spend over one trillion dollars on health care, incarceration, homelessness services and the like.  We would save $100 – 200+ billion as people would take better care of themselves and avoid the emergency room, jail, and the street and would generally be more functional.  The Freedom Dividend would pay for itself by helping people avoid our institutions, which is when our costs shoot up.  Some studies have shown that $1 to a poor parent will result in as much as $7 in cost-savings and economic growth.

>2.  A VAT.  Our economy is now incredibly vast at $19 trillion, up $4 trillion in the last 10 years alone.  A VAT at half the European level would generate $800 billion in new revenue.  A VAT will become more and more important as technology improves because you cannot collect income tax from robots or software.

>3.  New revenue.  Putting money into the hands of American consumers would grow the economy.  The Roosevelt Institute projected that the economy would grow by approximately $2.5 trillion and create 4.6 million new jobs.  This would generate approximately $800 – 900 billion in new revenue from economic growth and activity.

>4.  Taxes on top earners and pollution.  By removing the Social Security cap, implementing a financial transactions tax, and ending the favorable tax treatment for capital gains/carried interest, we can decrease financial speculation while also funding the Freedom Dividend.  We can add to that a carbon fee that will be partially dedicated to funding the Freedom Dividend, making up the remaining balance required to cover the cost of this program.",politics,t2_414cr9wo,coneao,ewk1gwl,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/ewk1gwl/,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/

Sanders does it all the time, so does Warren. And yes, UBI is Yang's trademark policy, but in the end he is still proposing to give each citizen $12,000 per year. I can guarantee you that if Sanders had proposed this before Yang did, the entire right-wing would have gone mental, calling it a lunacy upgrade from his $15 minimum wage proposal. Because after all, you still have to work for the $15 minimum wage, but you get the $1000 per month just like that.

And you can say what you want. Giving each and everyone $12,000 a year regardless of how much they work or what they do - that's socialism (whereas capitalism is the principle that you earn more if you do more). And I think that we need this socialist input in our country (it's a socialist base of income to secure proper living conditions, coupled with the capitalist model we know to ensure you can rise above living at poverty level through hard work), but let's call a spade a spade. 

Socialism didn't work in the past and pure socialism won't work in the future, but the rise of automation will make pure capitalism unsustainable. All other modern countries already use a mixture of socialism and capitalism, only we with our radical capitalism (work or die) and disdain for any regulation that would prevent corruption are lagging behind.",politics,t2_414cr9wo,coneao,ewmex4r,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/ewmex4r/,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/

His heart may be in the right place and some of his points are valid, but I do respectfully disagree with the premise of ""human centered capitalism.""

Here are the things he says that I like and agree with:

>Capitalism as an economic system has led to unparalleled innovation and improvement in the human condition.

This is, to a certain extent, true. Even Marx assessed capitalism as a leap forward in human history and remarked on its dynamic and iconoclastic character. He just thought we could do one or two better in later stages of historical development.

>our current version of institutional capitalism and corporatism is a relatively recent development

I have to give Yang credit for correctly historicizing our current phase of capitalism. This is a refreshing demystification of the typical capitalist realism that in naturalizing it, presents it as timeless and without alternative.

>Our current emphasis on corporate profits isn’t working for the vast majority of Americans. This will only be made worse by the development of automation technology and AI.

Again, I wholeheartedly agree. I would further add that failure to address these issues as well as climate change will likely cause global politics to lurch even further right into outright fascism.

>The focus of our economy should be to maximize human welfare.

Yes. It's sad that some people even take this to be a controversial statement.

All of that said, I think Yang offers only a partial diagnosis and therefore an insufficient prescription.

1. Humans are more important than money
2. The unit of a Human Capitalism economy is each person, not each dollar
3. Markets exist to serve our common goals and values

These are all laudable aspirations and may very well be sincere, but none of them are achievable so long as the majority of the means of production remain under the control of a class of self-interested individuals. Actual socialists and communists, as opposed to mere social democrats, are opposed to simply redistributing wealth and enacting a few regulations while keeping private capital ownership and the wage system intact for several reasons:

\-Social democracy is politically unsustainable and prone to the kind of capitalist counter-revolt we saw 40 years ago because it doesn't really de-fang capitalists. So long as they still own the engines of economic creation, whatever rules we put to paper cannot stop our employers and their stakeholders from flipping the table and changing the rules as soon as the opportunity presents itself.

\-Regulations always have to play catch-up or whack-a-mole against a system that ultimately defers to the prerogatives of individual owners of the means of production; such an approach is clearly not up to the task of our unfolding environmental crisis which isn't just pollutant X, Y, and Z on the margins but habitat destruction and greenhouse gases that are strongly correlated to nearly all of our current economic activity.

\-Even regulated capitalism is prone to overproduction and a falling rate of profit which produces periodic crises that range from minor recessions to largescale wars. In addition to the widespread suffereing these these crises directly cause, they also provide the opportunity for the capitalist counter-revolts I mentioned above.

\-While welfare systems may save people from capitalism's worst indignities of homelessness, starvation, and other deprivations, they do not address the fundamental issue of what Marx termed alienation. I know this is a little abstract and philosophical compared to my other points of basic survival for people and the planet. But if we are, as Yang presumably is, concerned more broadly with not just survival but human thriving and the full development of each person's potential, we need a system where people have democratic and collective control over their own labor and by extension the whole economy. Democracy can't just be a once every one or four year exercise, but at the heart of our daily working lives.

\-The technological innovations of AI and automation Yang describes will only yield dividends to those who own those technologies. Keynes predicted we would already be down to a 15 hour work week, but that's because he didn't understand this point. These and all technological innovations are rightfully ours, not only the Bezos and Musks of the world, because they are the result of the collective labor of our generation and all prior generations.",politics,t2_414cr9wo,coneao,ewltous,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/ewltous/,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/

UBI isn't really anything novel. It's just warmed over social democratic policy but with a slightly more neoliberal tinge in that it finds a way to bring markets into the mix instead of straight up nationalizing an industry and de-commodifying its goods and services.

If we are going to do a band-aid to staunch the bleeding, we may as well do something that doesn't reinforce capitalist and market relations. That's why I support Bernie even though he isn't really a socialist but merely a social democrat.

People decry Bernie and his supporters as utopians as if his policies are the end goal. They should instead be thought of as merely the tiniest first steps to raising a revolutionary consciousness.

We keep saying we’re at record lows in terms of unemployment, but barely anyone says that this is based on the population of people actively looking for work. There are many people who would normally be eligible for work but have given up on searching and are excluded from this calculation. Currently, there are  ~96 million people who have called it quits. That is an abysmal number of people for whom the system has failed.

This figure of ~96 million is only going to get larger as the jobs of today are scrapped and technology is only going to get more effective and faster than the creation of new jobs. 8 years is enough time for a lot of people to be put out of work due to these big changes.

Maybe they have free healthcare and are debt free after college, which is obviously a great thing. But they will struggle to put food on the table, be happy and fulfilled.

A robot can do your job much better than you. That's a fact. Robots don't get tired. They don't get distracted. They don't need breaks, except for maintenance. And assembly-line workers are the easy ones. There will be a point where every job can be done by a robot or artificial intelligence.

The only jobs which are going to be done by humans are jobs where the bosses specifically want humans to be involved. As an example, a place like Disneyland would likely want humans to be around because that's the ""feel"" they go for. However, even if they were going for a human ""feel,"" any job which could be automated -- [like taking pictures](https://wdwnt.com/2019/02/photos-automated-photopass-cameras-installed-at-town-square-theater/) -- will be automated. 

Even if a company wants to maintain a human ""feel,"" it'll only last until a new money-pinching CEO sees that robots are much cheaper than humans (and don't require benefits, to boot!).

Even creative jobs will be hit. Robots and AI don't necessarily need someone to guide them -- a sufficiently trained robot should be able to emulate ""creativity"" and get a desired reaction out of humans. Even the algorithm which guides this ""creativity"" can be written by a robot. No job is safe, and it's already coming. Google expects to achieve Quantum Supremacy this year. Once that milestone is hit, things will be kicked up to 11. We need to have a safety net for humans when the robot revolution does come -- and it's on the way.

People made fun of Yang for talking about Skynet during the debates... but that's a real concern. Again, we won't be maintaining any of these robots directly; it'd be robots maintaining robots. We don't even fully understand how to describe what's going on inside a modern-day deep learning neural network, other than linear algebra and if statements. It's certainly an option that the robots decide humans are the thing to get rid of, as silly as it sounds.

This all sounds crazy, and I know a lot of people don't think it's going to happen. But full automation is pretty much certain at this point (although the timeline is uncertain) and while Skynet is a little silly, it's still a non-zero possibility in an automated future.

I personally think Yang is the candidate with the most forward-thinking mindset, based on where things are going instead of where they are now. But I don't see him getting the mainstream support Warren and Bernie get, so I'm not sure if I'll vote for him in the primary in case the vote gets split and Biden takes it.",politics,t2_414cr9wo,coneao,ewlejpt,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/ewlejpt/,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/

The safety net that would take ages for approval for some people?

We're talking about the safety net that kicks you off if you start making too much income therefore disincentivizing you from progressing in fear of losing your benefits, in a way ""trapping"" you.

UBI would stack on some of the programs, succeed where our safety net fails, and it's unconditional. For people with disabilities and who prefer staying on programs such as SSI (SSDI stacks on UBI), Yang has mentioned that he will scale benefits such as exempting them from the price increase due to the VAT. He is also planning to implement the VAT mostly on luxury goods while reducing or exempting VAT on staple goods.

Yang is by no means 'embarrassing' at all. He is intelligent af and is talking about automation that will wipe out jobs and has a plan for it, while it's \*crickets\* from Warren and Bernie.

We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work; but many against combining to raise it. In all such disputes the masters can hold out much longer. A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him; but the necessity is not so immediate.

There is likely going to be some price increase from companies paying the 10% VAT. Yang acknowledges this. Your fear is hyperinflation. 

UBI does not manipulate the money supply therefore the value of a dollar will not change. And on the topic of money supply and inflation the FED wasn’t even able to achieve 2% inflation pumping 4T new dollars into the money supply from 2009-2015 (Quantitative Easing).

Secondly, there will not be any shortage of supply as demand increases. This applies to housing as well. It’s estimated that there are 5 times as many vacant homes as there are homeless people. Furthermore nobody is going to want to sink more money into the same apartment because owners decided to jack up prices. The most affordable apartments win. There are too many competitors in that market for owners to coordinate an across the board rent hike. Competition will work in our favor. 

UBI empowers bargaining by putting resources in people’s hands. Simply put you could hold out on a better opportunity, have resources to relocate for a better opportunity, or create your own opportunity.

Basically by requiring recipients to be defined by their limitations to qualify for the benefits, they are less incentivized to better themselves. 

I think that criticism way oversimplifies welfare, but there is an argument there. E.g., my father-in-law is on disability and wanted to look into lighter-level work just for meaning of life, but he never did out of fear of losing his benefits. 

UBI eliminates means testing, which is why it’s actually a feature—not a bug—that everyone gets it and not just those in the most need. It eliminates the stigma of being in need as well as incredibly difficult task of clearly defining “in need”. Being the left, I’ve had a tendency to treat red rural communities struggling with poverty like idiots for voting against their own interests.

As far as taxes on your average individual are concerned, as long as they're not spending >$10,000 a month, they come out ahead with the UBI. The VAT would disproportionately affect higher spenders/earners and corporations. This also isn't the only way to fund it--note that these all come from new sources of revenue, but he could use other already existing sources. We have more than enough money as a nation that we can make it happen. Having a UBI lowers costs in many areas that it is likely very worth it in the long term even if we have to spend more for it upfront (reduced crime, lower healthcare costs on a national level, much less cost attributed to the homeless, etc.). There are many studies that suggest these positive effects will happen.

Edit: note that EU countries collect 9.7% in GDP from VAT, so Yang's proposed VAT would do half of that. Also, consumer staples like food would be exempt from the VAT.",politics,t2_414cr9wo,coneao,ewkffya,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/ewkffya/,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/

Total 18+ population = 250 million

12k / year = 3 trillion

Let’s be optimistic and say that there would be increased taxes, productivity, shopping, all that. And let’s say a third of welfare people choose 1k/mo instead. Maybe that’s 1 trillion? IDK

So if the VAT includes all categories except medicine and healthcare,

to raise 2 trillion, it would have to be about 25%. (not 10%) as Yang suggests.

The break even point, where 1000/month is better than 25% VAT is $4,000 per month expenses per individual.

For 2 adults, they’d have to spend over $8000 per month to start losing money.

Median household expenses is $5000.

So actually even at 25% VAT, it’d be good for over half of the people.

This is one of those speeches I wish I could link, but in [""FAST 5""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqjeOYeG5_A) the villain was a drug lord in Rio and he was untouchable.

The reason he gave in this 1 minute speech was because of how ""the Portuguese"" handled invasion vs ""the Spanish"". Now, I'm paraphrasing from memory but it goes something like this: 

""The Spanish came, guns a-blazing, determined to show everyone who was boss... and eventually they natives killed every last Spaniard. When you threaten people with violence, they will eventually respond with violence because they have nothing to lose.""

""I much prefer the tactics of the Portuguese... when they came over they came bearing gifts. They offered sizzors, tools, trinkets in trade... but to get them you had to work for the Portuguese. I offer the people electricity... clean water, schools for their kids... and for this  chance for a better life... I own them.""

>Strengthening entitlements. 

Yang is for this. His VAT will still apply to people who don’t opt into UBI, so he wants to make sure they don’t get screwed. Also, UBI is literally the ultimate entitlement.

>Reducing the military. 

Yang is for this.

>Debt/loan forgiveness

Yang is for this, although his policy doesn’t go as far as Bernie’s.

>taxing the fuck out of billionaires

Yang is for this. He wants to introduce a financial transactions tax and tax capital gains as income. His VAT will only draw money from people making over $500,000/year, because everyone else will get reimbursed by the UBI for way more than they spend.

Fucking nonsense.  VATs, like all sales taxes, are regressive and therefore disproportionately affect LOW income earners.

What you're confusing is the amount of VAT paid and the portion of income paid to VAT.  Suppose we have two people.  One who spends $15k/mo and earns $45k/mo - they're certainly high income, that's $540k/yr.  They pay VAT on $15k/mo, which is the same as paying VAT on 33% of their income.

Now compare someone who spends $800/mo and earns $2000/mo.  While they pay VAT on just $800/mo and therefore pay significantly less VAT than the high income earner, they are paying VAT on 40% of their income.  

That's why it's regressive - the effective tax rate paid via VAT is higher on our person who earns $2k/mo and spends just $800/mo while the high income high expense person spending $15k/mo on a $45k/mo income pays a lower effective VAT rate.  Namely, if the VAT rate is X the high income earner would pay 0.33X while the low income earner pays 0.4X.

And these examples are deliberately ""close"" in the effective rate.  In the real-world, it's hard to spend $15K/mo ($180k/yr) on taxable consumer goods at a $540k income while low income earners generally have a fixed floor for spending that they can't go below.  There's simply a fixed cost to simply live, and as your income goes down closer and closer to it the more that VAT is going to affect you.  The high-income earners wouldn't notice if their widget costs 10% more, it doesn't matter but to a low-income earner, paying 10% more for basic essentials is cruel.  

Yes, the UBI offsets that.  If you view these as two separate policies one is pretty progressive and one is incredibly regressive so they absolutely must be tied to each other in order to work.  The ""economic boost"" nonsense is what Republicans refer to as ""dynamic scoring"" - it's how they push trickle down economics and it's a known scam.  Any analysis requiring ""dynamic scoring"" to come out in the black is a lie and whoever pushes it is a con artist.",politics,t2_414cr9wo,coneao,ewkng2a,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/ewkng2a/,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/

They’re counting on the fact that most Yang supporters won’t read or understand the “evidence” they’ve provided and when questioned about the details of Yang’s rollout of UBI I bet they’ll continue to point at “studies” without actually answering the important questions like “how can you guarantee people will spend the freedom dividend so we don’t repeat the Bush tax cuts?” Or “why do you deny the inflationary effects so many scholars accept as an inevitable consequence?”",politics,t2_414cr9wo,coneao,ewvg81r,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/ewvg81r/,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/

I’ll also restate what I said in my other comment about his backtracking on M4A which disappointed me. I donated to every candidate that supported single payer or Medicare for all, which included him and tulsi, and both of them backtracked.

Also I’m not trying to lie. The last poll I saw had him at 1% and now he’s at 2-3%. Don’t fault me for that polls change so frequently and before the recent ones he was at 1% for like 4 months. Good for him for growing but still I think my point about low polling among democrats stands.

However with Medicare he’s misrepresenting what he has said. Single payer/M4A is my biggest issue and the thing I look into the most for each candidate. Yang said in the debates and in interviews he wants a Medicare for all public option. That doesn’t make any sense. You either want a public option or you want a Medicare for all/single payer system. 

As far as I know he supports the existence of private insurance companies for health care still and supports a public option. I’ve donated to his campaign in the past along with Tulsi and Warren who also support or supported M4A at one point. Yang used to support Bernie’s M4A bill but has since back tracked to a public option.

On that page he lays out his goals and says what needs to change but uses Medicare for all in a misleading way which I find disappointing. From everything he’s said recently he seems like he supports a public option or “Medicare for all who want it”. 

I’d recommend reading this. it breaks down each candidates stance on M4A and private insurance. I’d say he’s close to what Pete has been saying. Sadly I just disagree and I’m sad he’s changed his stance.

Yang has said he is for raising the capital gains tax, he has a policy on carbon tax and financial transaction tax, so he is proposing raising taxes in these areas as well. Rich people have assets that grow in value over time (stocks and bonds), you will never see their net worth decline and net worth of an average person increase if all you did was raise minimum wage. What you can do is establish a reasonable wage ratio, and establish other entitlements to company equity, and make owning equity easier - most people expect to own a house and cars that add to their equity. Ownership of assets is an important part of narrowing the wealth gap.

Yang also wants to promote financial literacy so people aren't making poor decisions regarding finance - I know so many people paying thousands of dollars in credit card interest but they don't have to, they have other options but they either don't know or they are just too lazy to do their research. 

This also might be controversial thing to say here but I don't think ""wealth gap"" is wrong as long as an average person has high standards of living. The problem is poverty and scarcity. If people's needs are met - things like nutrition, housing, education, opportunities, and to some extent entertainment and having purpose in life, I don't think it's a tragedy that there is a wealth gap in the world. There are always going to be people that will do better than others based on various factors. What matters is happiness of the general population rather than equality of wealth across the board. There is a larger point to be made that rich aren't paying their fair share, which I will agree with, but even if they did, a wealth gap would still exist.",politics,t2_414cr9wo,coneao,ewpaz4s,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/ewpaz4s/,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/

Like you said, the reason that UBI + VAT works is they kind of balance each other out. The VAT does indeed regressively affect low income earners more on the basis of percentage of income, but the analysis shows that the UBI more than offsets that.

If you want to frame it differently, a VAT + UBI is really just a way to get money from corporations and high spenders into the hands of the less affluent. By taxing everybody, though, it makes this ""redistribution"" seem more fair.

I admit that there is a chance the UBI + VAT cancel each other out and effectively do nothing for most people, but I don't think that will happen. I am not an economist, but many economists do support UBI. I'm sure there are many who disagree with it, too. Even though I think UBI isn't a perfect solution, that doesn't mean we shouldn't do it--I strongly believe that having a UBI is better than our current system. If it ends up not working out perfectly, the details can be tweaked. Also, even Andrew Yang admits that UBI is not the end all solution to all our problems, but he believes it is a stop gap that will bridge our current system to a better system.

With a $1,000 Universal Basic Income, my 3 roommates and myself would have $48,000 of *no strings attached cash*. Not only that, my brother, my mother, my mom, grandmother, sister in law, nephew, etc, will each have their own UBI as well. 

Do you know what my roommates and I are planning to do with UBI? There’s collective decision making that so far only the wealthy have had the privilege of having. 

A Universal Basic Income like Yang’s is tied to inflation of staple goods and exists in an economy where 3D printers are almost cheap enough to exist in consumer homes. 

Not only that, you’re starting to see young adult video gamers make millions of dollars playing video games. World of Warcraft characters self for thousands of dollars, same for in game items and virtual real estate. 

Capitalism is eating itself as technology creates post scarcity, for most purposes.

Yep Yang is really suckling the tit of oligarchs. These are all policies the rich and wealthy fully support. You clearly haven't actually listened to Yang other than random cherrypicked clips. These are all policies that will either help workers or hurt oligarchs. 

The VAT is not regressive the way he has proposed it be structured. It will be on luxury goods not staples. Also every single advanced nation in the world has one, even the very progressive Scandinavian countries because it's nigh impossible to avoid unlike income taxes and others. 

His proposed VAT is 10%, even with full pass through of cost to the consumer (which doesn't happen basically anywhere) you would have to spend 120,000 dollars a year on luxury goods for it NOT to be a net gain so that point you made is basically just incorrect for most of the population.

>All he has is a libertarian ubi as vehicle to gut social safetynet as per his own word

made me think that Yang came out and said: ""The only proposal I have is UBI which can be used to gut social programs"" (obviously more subtly). While he said something close to the second half, regarding gutting the programs, he never said anything that even sounded like ""UBI is the only policy I am proposing"". And so my remarks about him wanting medicare for all still stands. 

Second, what he said could only be construed as ""I WANT TO CUT BENEFITS"" if you're being very uncharitable. I actually transcribed the entirety of the relevant Yang segment, you're welcome to read it. Maybe reading words allows you to process information better, idk.

*Rubin talks about the current six hundred billion in safetynets and whether it would be axed or not*

""Well, that's the beauty of the freedom dividend proposal. You have the six hundred billion or so, and then you're saying, ""guess what, its now a new reign of citizenship, everyone gets it [UBI]"", and then what's gonna happen is you're gonna dramatically reduce the enrollment of these programs very very quickly because **a lot of people will be like ""I prefer the cash""** and then the new incoming populations would just **opt** for the dividend and then never end up on these welfare programs and you'd end up shrinking the enrolment in these programs but you won't do it all at once cuz, you know, there are a lot of people in very distinct situations and this is actually much more politically feasible and popular than going and trying to tear these programs up and trying tear these programs up.""


You and that YouTuber only heard the last part, which I will get to. But first, notice how this all choice. Individuals will choose to take the thousand dollars a month. They will opt for it. They are not being forced into it. Then, when less and fewer people are taking the other benefits, obviously it will be cut because fewer people are choosing to take it VOLUNTARILY. they are choosing the dividend over food stamps. Like, reducing welfare is not inherently a bad thing. It could be because fewer people need welfare. Would you oppose measures to lift people out of poverty if I told you it would also mean there would be less money for food stamps and unemployment in the long run because people just don't need it anymore? of course fucking not. Also rememeber that UBI is optional, so if someone wants to keep their food stambs, they are more than welcome to. 

And now I'll address the part that makes it seem like a sneaky sneak. This is called knowing your audience. It's an excellent tactic, albeit a bit snakey. If I'm a leftist pacifist who hates war, and I am on a libertarian talk show. If they ask about cutting the military, sure Ill say ""war is bad"". But because I know my audience, I will also mention that we spend so much, and libertarians should be against spending taxpayer money, etc, etc. That way I make them agree with me, which is the goal. If he can spin it as ""less money on welfare in the long run"" and get libertarians on board, then of fucking course he should. Just because Libertarians agree with something, does not make it inherently bad. 

Further, nowhere did he ever say that UBI is all he has, and if you do find a clip I'm fairly confident that looking at the context would reveal that he meant it in the sense that UBI is all that sets him noticeably apart from the others, because just like the others, he also wants medicare for all, cheaper tuition (although I prefer Sanders and Warren here because he doesn't want free tertiary education, just cheaper unis), carbon tax, etc. 


Further, the guy who made that video you linked is a bit of a muppet. At the forty second mark, he says ""you can just give people healthcare"", but Yang wants medicare for all (unless of course, he's lying, but you haven't given any evidence for that).

at around the fifty-second mark, he misquotes the amount of money being given as three thousand a year when its actually twelve thousand a year. He then goes on a ramble about baby bonds and other welfare programs but ignores the fact that Yang is making UBI optional, and that you can choose to keep the other benefits instead. I could go on but this is getting long so I'll just summarise.


1. There is no evidence at ALL that UBI is Yangs only policy proposal. If it were his only legitimate proposal, he sure spent too much time or paid someone way too much to put together a website with a hundred and six policy proposals in detail.

https://www.yang2020.com/policies/

2. Just because Yang said a benefit of UBI is that the enrollment in other welfare programs will decrease, does not make UBI bad. Decreasing poverty will make enrollment in those programs decrease, doesn't make decreasing poverty bad. Raising minimum wage would make enrollment in these programs decrease, doesn't make raising minimum wage bad. Fucking taxing the rich and using that money to improve schools, public transport, and healthcare would decrease the number of people using the safetynet, and that doesn't make them bad. None of those examples are trojan horse libertarian ideas but can be sold as such by someone who wants to sell it like that.",politics,t2_414cr9wo,coneao,ewl4s4n,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/ewl4s4n/,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/

In straw polls in Yangs sub, his pull from Dems or left leaning independents is 70ish percent of his following which granted is not scientific but it's something. I truly think as the field shrinks this will begin to show as more people actually hear about him.

Also keep in mind that Yang's into some nasty social credit score shit: *
The government’s goal should be to drive individuals and organizations to find new ways to improve the standards of living of individuals and families on these dimensions.  In order to spur development, the government should issue a new currency – the Digital Social Credit – which can be converted into dollars and used to reward people and organizations who drive significant social value.  This new currency would allow people to measure the amount of good that they have done through various programs and actions.*


Look, workers and capital have an inherently antagonistic relationship. When people like Musk or Bezos advocate UBI, it's because it'll benefit them, at the cost of workers. It undermines unions, which are (ostensibly) worker-driven, and makes wages a matter for the capital and it's puppet state.

I don't think UBI has to be a **bad** band aid on the chopped off arm of capitalism, but any UBI supported by the likes of Musk will be bad for us, or he wouldn't support it. A good UBI system would have to provide enough income that noone feels a *need* to work for the capitalists, but Musk would never support that.

Education is a public good and should be invested in for its own sake (apart from the our current market-centric idea of education being a “career training program”), but it’s not a cure-all for the systemic economic issues we’re facing.

I’m a Sanders supporter who’s been a proponent of UBI for many years and I’m extremely grateful to Yang for normalizing the public discourse around UBI. If Yang won the nomination, I’d proudly vote for him in a heartbeat and I think he’d be a great asset to any progressive presidential administration.

My biggest criticism of Sanders is that he leans too heavily into education and “retraining programs” to combat automation-driven income inequality. This idea that *people* can just learn the “right skills” is hopelessly flawed. I’m also a big supporter of trade unions and organized labor in general, but Sanders seems to view automation as a potential “worker’s revolution”, which is admirable, but at least three decades out of date.

Let's ask the basic questions like why is post-secondary education not responding to market principles where supply should increase with the demand? Why are do prices continue to rise on in an industry that should have more  technological tools available (MOOC, communication tools.) than at any time previously? These tools should be driving DOWN prices, not increase them. 

Many factors are at play, but people should realize that 1) cheap student loans are currently skewing the price of post-secondary school education by allowing universities to charge prices the market would not otherwise rationalize and 2) top-end schools are not motivated to increase their supply to meet the greater market demand - alumni groups don't want their quality education to be more widely available.",politics,t2_414cr9wo,coneao,ewv0gqq,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/ewv0gqq/,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/

Im pretty much a single issue voter with single payer/M4A and I won’t support any candidate who is against it. Right now Warren and Bernie are the only candidates I support because they are clear hardline single payer supporters.

A public option is a step in the right direction but it’s not good enough. We need to move to a single payer system and stop kicking the can down the road. Like I said I previously donated to him because he use to support that and Bernie’s M4A bill. He’s back tracked since then. 

I’ll also say again the way he uses the phrase Medicare for all is misleading because that’s not what he’s proposing. He’s making a very open ended statement there.

If you are worried that he isn't liberal enough or he's too much of a capitalist or he has some sort of libertarian core (despite his history which does not suggest that), read/listen/watch more of him.

He's a progressive who is focused on selling conservatives on progressive ideals and uniting the good people of the country who are simply turned off by the political name calling and demonizing. He's trying to win those people back. It's not a coincidence that progressive policies/ideas are extremely popular but yet our politicians still lose elections.

Andrew Yang is extremely progressive and if he were to miraculously come out ahead and win, he would be a great progressive president who would change politics even if he failed to secure the freedom dividend. His mindset and non-combative problem solving approach is needed. Bernie and Warren, as much as I would LOVE to vote for them, aren't going to have a shot at changing the dirty political landscape of Washington.

This can be calculated with the following equation

Spending * 10/100 = $1000

Then we solve for spending:

Spending * 1/10 = $1000  
Spending / 10 = $1000

In order to spur development, the government should issue a new currency – the Digital Social Credit – which can be converted into dollars and used to reward people and organizations who drive significant social value.

He actually does propose this but says it requires time, because the current benefits system often have things that can disqualify you. He obviously didnt say that in a libertarian talk show because he's trying to win those votes.


>reducing welfare is not inherently a bad thing.

You ignored the rest of that lmao. I'm beginning to think you genuinely cant read or just have a hate boner for Asian people and that's why you don't like Yang. Your level of argumentation is comparable to conservatives hating Obama. Like ""he doesn't actually want medicare because HES NOT WARREN OR SANDERS"" is not an argument. He cant be in league with libertarians because he literally wants a carbon tax and thinks the government needs to act to solve climate change, he wants medicare for all regardless of what you say, and he doesn't want to increase the GDP for the sake of increasing it. 


TLDR you genuinely can't read and didn't address a single point I made. You said my arguments were wrong without explaining the flaw in the argumentation. You literally have no argumentation so I can't criticize it. You just state bullshit.

Interestingly, if you watch the alt-right playbook, it says that the alt-right just hurl accusations without substance and force others to go on the defensive. You are literally doing that by accusing Yang of being libertarian, by accusing him of having no other policies, and by accusing him of only pretending to want medicare for all.

At the same time, he made a number of extremely offensive comments about gay people, comments that Tulsi herself took a long, long time to even attempt to distance herself from.

My gf and I have a tentative plan to move cheap and save up for a home. 

Raising prices as a reason not to increase minimum wage is a bullshit scare tactic from the right-wing. However, that doesn't mean prices don't rise; just that they don't rise as much as the wage increases. The same is likely to be true for UBI, which is why I worded my post the way I did.

> That’s time banking. China’s Sesame credit is based on personal history. 

Except the time banking and gauging of what is a ""social value"" is in this case controlled by the government, and thus capital.

> If you’re concerned about money used as an incentive for publicly accepted initiatives you should be fucking terrified about a Federal Jobs Guarantee in a world in which automation is increasingly devaluing human labor. More people will be forced to rely on government jobs programs of busy work and if they’re critical of said government, they’re gonna starve. 

Automation isn't devaluing human labour. Capitalism is. Automation increases the value of human labour, as the same amount of human labour produces far more social goods. It's just that this increase isn't seen by the actual labourers (neither those constructing, maintaining or operating the machinery) but the owners of the machines.

Also, yes, I do worry about that. I've been stuck in similar things before here in Sweden and it's not great. But at least it's easier to organize and share experiences around that kind of situation. But yeah, that's not a solution either. What we need to do is shift economic system.

> But you’ve nodded that you’re not inherently against UBI, so we understand each other. I think if you bothered to read Yang’s book or listen to him as he’s talking here in Iowa you’d see that you’re reflecting rhetoric

I am inherently against UBI as a way of organizing the economy, but I don't inherently think it's a bad band-aid that's worse than not having it in our current system. However, for UBI not to be bad, it would have to be done in a way that will never happen under capitalism, because it harms capitalists.

UBI can be made in a way that depowers the working class, by providing just enough to barely keep us functioning, so that there's always a large pool of desperate people but no good way to organize as striking is pointless and everything is individualized. Neoliberals love this idea, especially when coupled with defunding other social support system.


UBI could also be made in a way that empowers workers, by making it high enough that noone feels a need to work and can freely organize as a class without the threats of being fired or whatever. Where the resources we have access to is enough that we can use means other than striking. That will never happen.",politics,t2_414cr9wo,coneao,ewlvu97,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/ewlvu97/,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/

Job A is unskilled and so automated, not because Yang but because Amazon. So Person A is without a job.  

  

Person A was making a livable wage, but after being replaced with a robot no longer has the livable wage they had. Instead, that wage is replaced with $1,000/month, which is below the poverty line, and thousands of dollars/month less than what they were making.  

  

As that person was on a relatively low wage, unskilled job as it was, they most likely had little savings.

That depends on the individual. I have been laid off a few times and always managed to find a higher paying job than my last one because I spent some time learning new skills or getting certifications that made me more hirable. In the time I was not working, I was using unemployment insurance to get by.

I don't think automation will create a jobless future. What we will see is new jobs being created mostly in tech or local businesses as more people will be encouraged to be entrepreneurial. People will have to train for these new jobs. 

Yang isn't against retraining programs, but they aren't the most successful at retraining people. He believes it is best to leave it up to people to make their own decision on what they want to do. I know some people that would stop working if they were getting 1-2K monthly from their pooled UBI. These are low skilled people that have little marketability and aren't happy in the work force. They would be better off not working and living on 1-2K monthly stipend. I also know people that would continue to work and use that money for a big purchase. 

>The Trump voter is probably the person who benefits least from this. Their jobs will be automated with no replacement, but $1000 keeps them basically at poverty level in geographic areas that have no ability/willingness to provide training or jobs that pay more. 

Part of his UBI appeal is to encourage more people to stay in rural areas and to encourage people who don't want to live in big cities to move to rural areas. If there are local businesses being created and people are much more comfortable with their UBI in rural areas vs. in a big city - this will encourage population to stay near their home town. It will also encourage people to move to a big city only if they want to live in one, not because they have to because of jobs.

It's interesting, because the same rejection of the notion of deserving has also been done in basically the opposite context. As anarcha-pacifist Sci-Fi legend Ursula K. Le Guin's wrote in the Dispossessed:

> A thin, small, middle-aged man beside Trepu began speaking, at first so softly, in a voice hoarsened by the dust cough, that few of them heard him. He was a visiting delegate from a Southwest miners' syndicate, not expected to speak on this matter. *“...what men deserve,”* he was saying. *“For each of us deserve everything, every luxury that was ever piled in the tombs of the dead kings, and we each of us deserve nothing, not a mouthful of bread in hunger. Have we not eaten while another starved? Will you punish us for that? Will you reward us for the virtue of starving while others ate? No man earns punishment, no man earns reward. Free your mind of the idea of deserving, the idea of earning, and you will begin to be able to think.”* They were, of course, Odo's words from the Prison Letters, but spoken in the weak, hoarse voice they made a strange effect, as if the man were working them out word by word himself, as if they came from his own heart, slowly, with difficulty, as the water wells up slowly, slowly, from the desert sand.

But here its meaning is the opposite; not ""every person for themself"", but ""we're all in this together"". *Deserving* is often used as a way to deny people things; whether denying a prisoner freedom because they don't ""deserve"" it, or denying the people access to the things they need because the capitalists ""deserve"" their wealth. We all deserve everything, and we all deserve nothing; our actions should not be taken on the basis of who deserves what, but based on compassion and empathy.",politics,t2_414cr9wo,coneao,ewlwj79,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/ewlwj79/,/r/politics/comments/coneao/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_said_he_supports_democratic/

So it’s different because minimum wage only helps some people and as long as there are people who are destitute, renters can’t exploit fully?

>To say that technological evolutions will just go smoothly without disruption to economies, politics, and occupational sectors was the main point when I said the earlier comment was naive.

We are hundred percent in agreement I was simply adding further context and expanding on the industrial revolution comparison (as its a small pet peeve of mine. Not that you were doing that but the comparison is used as an excuse to downplay the idea that capitalism and future automated economy are mutually exclusive systems). Even automated cars people just think ""Truck drivers"" even if they could just retrain quickly, how many towns on major highways exists near solely to service said truck drivers, how many auto body shops, diners. With self driving cars, how many police officers have their jobs solely to meet demand of traffic enforcement, what about the insurance industry when car accidents and liabilities plummet. Supply chain management when the transport of materials can be automated from start to end of production. This kind of Automation will send absolute shockwaves through the economy.

>It’s for this reason ( among many others) that UBI could be useful in stabilizing society while humanity adjusts to and navigates these changes.

100% agree. I feel strongly that we need to accept that that there will simply not be enough work for everyone to generate economic ouput from their labor value equal to their consumption. In other words labor will not have enough value for people to ""pay their costs of living"". We need to accept that the capitalist model that values people by their economic output wont hold up.

If you believe in UBI, and also admit that it isn't enough, then you should be the one offering the rest of the solution. The fact that I don't necessarily have a solution doesn't mean there isn't a huge flaw in the program as it currently stands.  

  

As far as I understand it, there are two problems that UBI is trying to mitigate. First, due to jobs becoming automated, people will need some income because they will no longer have a job. Second, that giving everyone a basic income would help people to make more self-interested decisions as far as occupations go, instead of feeling trapped in a job they don't like. The rationale behind having UBI as the solution to these two issues is conflicting though.    

  

For the first issue, while these are relatively low-paying jobs, many of them are (a) the only jobs in the area, (b) the only jobs they are qualified for, and (c) the jobs that many people use to support their families. Auto-workers, truck drivers, etc. These people have mortgages, car payments, and multiple mouths to feed. They often do not have much in savings, and the $1,000 would not be sufficient to pay their bills.  

  

So, the idea is that they'd hopefully be able to find other work, and that UBI would help bridge the gap. **But, we already established as part of the first premise that the low-wage unskilled jobs have been automated, or else there wouldn't be a need for UBI in the first place.** So, there are no jobs that this person is qualified for. Even if there are some part-time positions available, you all of a sudden have millions of extra people in the work force all going for the same part-time jobs. There wouldn't be enough to go around. And since it seems you've admitted that your path to owning a business is not a parallel to this hypothetical, that's not an option either.  

**UBI under Yang would cost $2.8 trillion dollars** ***a year.***  That's an awful lot of money to spend on something that isn't actually going to solve the problem. A simple solution would be to have a welfare program where if someone gets laid off due to automation, then they apply for this program and receive a percentage of their previous income, for a given period of time, but they would have to sign up and complete alternative job training in fields that the government wants to supplement, like clean energy. I make $70k/year, and while I'd love an extra $1,000/month, I don't need it, and those more well off than me certainly don't either.

3226,ssmolko,https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/08/16/heres-what-universal-basic-income-ubi-could-mean-for-your-money.html,">The idea of guaranteeing every citizen an income from the government is an old one, first recorded during the Renaissance. **In America, it was picked up by founding father Thomas Paine, who referred to the payments as a “natural inheritance.”** 

This one quote shows, to me, just how unserious or misguided Yang is in his conception of UBI. Thomas Paine didn't say cash payments were a natural inheritance, he said *land* and value derived from it was, and that everyone ought to be paid a lump sum — generated from an estate tax — at the age of majority (plus some provisions for the elderly and infirm) as recompense for a system of private property that deprives people of that natural inheritance:

>To create a national fund, out of which there shall be paid to every person, when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the sum of fifteen pounds sterling, as a compensation in part, for the loss of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property:   
>  
>And also, the sum of ten pounds per annum, during life, to every person now living, of the age of fifty years, and to all others as they shall arrive at that age. 

Basically, Paine wanted something that looked a little like Booker's baby bonds + Social Security, paid as compensation for land monopoly, which is *very* different from Yang's ""let's put the burden of revenue generation on the backs of consumers and pretend we're sticking it to big business"" model.

Also, he ignores Henry George's legacy on the matter, which is just *insane*. George is *the* American UBI advocate, and any serious campaign for it would pull from his work.",politics,t2_w70eh18,crblid,ex3jgz0,/r/politics/comments/crblid/elon_musk_and_andrew_yang_support_universal_basic/ex3jgz0/,/r/politics/comments/crblid/elon_musk_and_andrew_yang_support_universal_basic/
3227,e_l_v,https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/08/16/heres-what-universal-basic-income-ubi-could-mean-for-your-money.html,"There are multiple problems with Yang’s UBI.  He’s proposing it as an either/or option against other security nets like Medicare, making people choose which benefit they want to receive.

First off, the FD is tied to inflation. Second off, massive inflation happens when money is printed, devaluing the dollar. No money is being printed when it comes to the FD (even if it was, the fed pumped trillions into the economy with quantative easing in the past decade and they failed to hit their inflation target (we don't want 0 inflation), so it's worth keeping in mind how tough it is to inflate things). Market forces will keep products low: why buy something expensive if a competitor has a cheaper product? Companies colluding together to raise the prices of all their goods gets into anti monopoly and antitrust laws aka this is already illegal.

There will be some of the VAT passe onto consumers, but data shows its usually 50% of the total VAT tax the companies pay. The majority of the money will increase consumers purchasing power, not go to vats. You can read more about that in this article which covers other topics: https://medium.com/basic-income/there-is-no-policy-proposal-more-progressive-than-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-72d3850a6245

As for rent, unfortunately the federal government doesn't have jurisdiction. Some cities and states will obviously handle updating rent laws better than others but many aready limit how fast rent can increase. Additionally a household of two adults would have an extra 24k a year, which helps them move if rent goes up, giving them more options. Maybe to even buy a house, or take a chance on a new job.

The freedom dividend will not fix all problems and it will result in new challenges, but consider your monopoly example: it's a much harder game if no one has any money at the start to actually buy property with.

It's capitalism that doesn't start at 0.

Most major American proponents of UBI have derived their position from a critique of land monopolies, so most have suggested generating the funds for a basic income through a tax on land value ([see Progress and Poverty if you want in-depth reasoning on why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_and_Poverty)).

An LVT/UBI system would prevent rent hikes because land is a fixed supply, the garnishing of inherent value prevents land speculation (eg buying vacant land, lobbying for public works improvements, and selling the land for profit without doing anything) and landlords are incentivized to do the most product work with their land at the lowest profitable cost (higher rent = higher value = higher tax). That means more housing built, lower costs, and more competition.

Your landlord doesn't have a monopoly on housing. Unless every single landlord in your area/city decided to all do this together, you'd just move. And now you have this money that travels **with you** so you're able to be more economically mobile.

Over the very long term, housing prices will always rise though, and the UBI will probably add to that. But i'm not talking about a sudden jack up of ""hey your rent is going up $900.""

2) ending fossil fuel subsidies, 

3) empowering the EPA to regulate carbon far more aggressively, 

4) continue to push for renewable, as the market is already doing this 

5) push for and develop NEW NUCLEAR, including developing non proliferatable and passively safe technologies like figuring out how to perfect Molten Salt reactors, 

6) research long-term international projects for geoengineering, including planting of up to 1 trillion trees, or shoring up glaciers with the help of other world powers, or being able to (over several years, and after sufficient research) possibly add aerosols to the atmosphere to increase reflectivity by a tiny % to help stave off the worst effects.

I feel dumber for having read this.

You don't understand how more money is more money than less money?

Demand can sometimes be characterized as supply...of money.

People have a lower supply of money ""right now.""

Money is not ""magic.""

If people only have $100 then a business pricing its items at $101 sells 0 items. Believe it or not, this is what is known as, in economics vernacular,  a ""bad thing.""

If that same business prices its items at $100, that business sells positive non-zero amounts of that item. This is what is known as a ""less bad thing.""

Only once people have more than $100 can that business raise its prices to any benefit.

It's basic logistics.

> hear you got a raise or a promotion?

Because not literally EVERY PERSON IN THE COUNTRY gets a raise at exactly the same time.

Also, raises and promotions are opaque, your landlord wouldn't hear about it unless they persistently require proof of income.

Also, businesses DO raise their prices over time.

It is what is known, in the parlance of the time, as ""inflation.""

It doesn't happen in response to a single person having more money.

But the entire population having more money? It certainly will and does.

And it happens across industries over similar time-frames, counteracting the existence of ""competition.""

They point to his Dave Rubin interview where he essentially said yeah i'm trying to use this to replace welfare and bring everyone in.

But arguing that UBI will somehow hurt the poor is absolutely ludicrous and ignores the reality of our current system.

- 77%(!!) of families in poverty receive **ZERO** cash benefit assistance. ZERO. NONE. Source: https://features.marketplace.org/yourstateonwelfare/

- Also, according to the cbpp, the median family benefit for a family of 3 (2 adults), for those 23% of families **already in poverty** is $450 per month. (https://www.cbpp.org/research/family-income-support/tanf-benefits-remain-low-despite-recent-increases-in-some-states)

- Most families in poverty **DO** get SNAP assistance, but only for food, and the average value is less than $250/month. Source: https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/a-quick-guide-to-snap-eligibility-and-benefits

- There definitely are families that receive over 1k/month in combined benefits, like those who get SSI benefits. This is not the norm, but they exist. Yang has specifically stated that he would want to **increase** their benefits to offset any harm done by a VAT to them. He stated this here, as well as elsewhere, multiple times: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ONkNw1jbVg&feature=youtu.be&t=840

- For the AVERAGE american not even in poverty, 40-70% (depending who is conducting the poll) cannot afford an unexpected $400 bill.

His goal is to make sure no one is worse off. If you listen to him speak at length, you'll probably believe him. I sure do.

So basically, this is what'll change with the implementation of UBI:

> The 13 million Americans living in poverty that receive no cash benefits at all will instantly have their household income jump by $1000 or $2000 (or more)


> The 1.4 million American families that currently do receive benefits will see their monthly benefits double or quadruple on average


> The 4/5 American workers that currently live paycheck to paycheck will receive a $1000 basic income floor that will keep them from falling into poverty in the first place

> The disabled will have their benefits stack on top of $1000

> The elderly/retired will have their social security stack on top of $1000

Like, almost every single person in the bottom 90% is better off. Poverty would be reduced by up to 70%. 

Here's a full distributional analysis on who are winners and losers in the UBI:

https://medium.com/basic-income/there-is-no-policy-proposal-more-progressive-than-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-72d3850a6245

A VAT is indeed regressive, but only by itself. a VAT+UBI (which is the only way the VAT would exist) is **highly** progressive.

Almost everywhere making less than 200k comes out ahead. Almost everyone making above 500k probably comes out behind because they are paying more into the VAT than they're getting from the 1k/month.


It is the single largest wealth transfer program ever proposed in history.

Thinking that he's trying to destroy the safety net is absolutely *ludicrous.*

----------------------------------------

I am a hardcore Yang supporter, but I DO BELIEVE there is a separate, worthwhile discussion about the long-term effects including things like expectations and inflation. We will have to fund the first year with a substantial deficit (300b-1.4T depending how it's structured or if it's phased in) but I mean, we're already doing this on incredibly wasteful spending 

We will almost certainly see a 3-5% rise in prices due to the VAT (""Cost-Push inflation""). We are unlikely to see surges in demand-pull inflation, because we are not substantially changing the M2 money supply and we are not increasing total spending by enough to outpace total production. Our economy is actually really, really big.",politics,t2_w70eh18,crblid,ex3l46z,/r/politics/comments/crblid/elon_musk_and_andrew_yang_support_universal_basic/ex3l46z/,/r/politics/comments/crblid/elon_musk_and_andrew_yang_support_universal_basic/

It's kinda like the analogy of Chris Matthews trying to get Warren or Bernie to say ""SO TAXES WILL GO UP, RIGHT?!"" and they are like ""but the average family isn't paying premiums now, so they are still WAY better off... you're ignoring the other half of the equation""

VAT by itself is regressive. VAT + UBI is super progressive.

So why a VAT instead of just a wealth tax or higher marginal income taxes? Because a VAT **guarantees** the revenue. You can't escape the VAT. There's no way to hide it, there's no way to game it, there's no way to move your assets around like Amazon does to pay 0 in federal taxes on their income.


Yes, the first year or two would probably substantially add to the deficit, something like 300b - 1.4 Trillion depending on how it's phased in. This is actually not nearly as bad as it sounds on paper. Yang is banking on the fact that this is real, Demand-Side economics which is going to cause enormous economic growth, particularly in the poorest communities, which he says will raise an additional 500b - 800b in new tax receipts per year, after growth. The economy will grow to a new equilibrium. We only need to grow it once to cover the cost of the UBI.

This is where conservatives attack him the most. Which makes sense, because conservatives have been selling voodoo supply-side economics for years knowing that it's patently false. Now that someone is actually proposing demand-side economics that will likely cause **real** growth, they're going to say it's all nonsense.",politics,t2_w70eh18,crblid,ex3oxep,/r/politics/comments/crblid/elon_musk_and_andrew_yang_support_universal_basic/ex3oxep/,/r/politics/comments/crblid/elon_musk_and_andrew_yang_support_universal_basic/

And *even the wealthiest people are eligible.* So, a multimillionaire could receive a check of $1000 a month of UBI, while his invested money already leaves him comfortably retired, but a poor person can only take so much of that if they want to keep their SS or Medicare (because they’re limited by the $1000 cap)?

It's important to remember the national picture here - many people live in or near expensive cities not because it's their first choice, but because that's where the capital and thus the jobs are. So if people decide to move somewhere they can afford, maybe even somewhere cheap enough to pay a mortgage with the Freedom Dividend ($2,000/mo for two adults), demand will go down.

Yang spent the last seven years trying to revitalize struggling cities like Detroit, Cleveland, New Orleans, Baltimore, etc. with his non-profit Venture for America. He decided to run on this platform after realizing he couldn't do enough without national support. The Freedom Dividend would provide $250m a month to Detroit alone, and half of the houses there are abandoned right now so property is dirt cheap. The story is similar in many cities across America, including numerous rural towns. The massive stimulus will breathe new life into local businesses, creating millions of jobs in places that are much cheaper to live in than the coastal hubs we're cramming ourselves into right now.

Even if demand does not go down, the Freedom Dividend will still improve the rental situation over time. This is because the decision to invest in anything has a lot to do with risk. If you know that every adult has an extra $1,000/mo in their pocket, it suddenly becomes a lot more attractive to build low-income housing because the risk of tenants defaulting on rent is dramatically reduced. He also wants to [start an initiative](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/zoning/) with localities to reduce zoning barriers to low-income housing.

Because a VAT **guarantees** the revenue. You can't escape the VAT. There's no way to hide it, there's no way to game it, there's no way to move your assets around like Amazon does to pay 0 in federal taxes on their income.

Ok, that's just not true. There are plenty of ways companies can avoid a VAT. You don't think companies can make fake invoices? That they can't get paid in cash while paying all their customers with traceable accounts? And Amazon or whoever won't be paying the VAT, consumers will be due to higher prices. Thus why it's a regressive tax.

All I'm asking is if there are the more progressive forms of taxes that could be implemented. I don't necessarily want to be locked down on this one option without exploring others as well. Maybe a VAT is the best proven way, but I'd like to have the robust debate first about it before definitely saying it's the best way to go.


>Yes, the first year or two would probably substantially add to the deficit, something like 300b - 1.4 Trillion depending on how it's phased in. This is actually not nearly as bad as it sounds on paper. Yang is banking on the fact that this is real, Demand-Side economics which is going to cause enormous economic growth, particularly in the poorest communities, which he says will raise an additional 500b - 800b in new tax receipts per year, after growth.

No, he doesn't say that. If you look at the underlying study by the Roosevelt institute, the estimated $900b in additional government revenue is over 8 years, or only ~$112b a year. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, and I'm not against driving demand side economics in general (I certainly believe in that more than supply side BS).

Let's say that last bit comes to $200 billion per year. Adding all the rosy projections up, we only get ~$2 trillion in new revenue/less spending. This is short the very simple projection above by about $1 trillion. Considering that our current budget is already over $1 trillion this year, this doesn't exactly seem like very good math.

It entirely does. He says this because he doesn't want to actually tackle capitalism. He's pro-capitalism. He's stated time and time again he's ""pro entrepreneur,"" he wants people to be able to use UBI to spend their free time working on business ideas rather than struggling to pay bills.

Unfortunately, time and time again Yang doesn't address how to account for any person who makes money off capitalism to just hike up their prices to consume the extra $1k a month people have.

EG: What's stopping landlords from increasing all their tenant's rent by $1000 a month if UBI were to be enacted? What stops retailers from marking all their products up by a flat % to get their cut of the UBI?

Almost nothing in Yang's proposed plan has shown true protection of citizens from predatory capitalistic techniques. THAT is my problem with his solution. He brings a great idea to the table, and I am super happy candidates and the media are willing to finally discuss a national UBI plan, but Yang's in current-form would be disastrous.

Not to mention, his technology tax won't even hit the tech giants in their revenue streams / impact their net worth. As Yang himself has said multiple times, ""It's too hard to properly tax Jeff Bezos. He can hire too many smart tax experts & lawyers to get around it.""

Meaning... Yang has no desire to fix the insanely fucked up tax codes that got us here. If he's not even willing to address correcting the tax codes such that Bezos can get away with paying nothing in taxes, then what the fuck are we even doing here?",politics,t2_w70eh18,crblid,ex3u3t8,/r/politics/comments/crblid/elon_musk_and_andrew_yang_support_universal_basic/ex3u3t8/,/r/politics/comments/crblid/elon_musk_and_andrew_yang_support_universal_basic/

I'm seeing a lot of 2-3% lately.

>EG: What's stopping landlords from increasing all their tenant's rent by $1000 a month if UBI were to be enacted?

Unless it's EVERY landlord doing it, what will happen is the scumbags will lose all of the business they have. If you are on a lease they can just suck it up. Month to month, the notice required depends on the state (usually 30 days or so, and if it's more than 10% in California it apparently jumps to 60 days).

If you talk to them and they just say ""lol fuck you give me your UBI money"", you can actually move. It's highly unlikely EVERY landlord has such a lack of morals. And since UBI isn't means tested and doesn't care about your working state, you can technically move to a different area entirely.

On the note of ""Landlord will just massively inflate pricing!"", what exactly is the plan when landlords get the same brilliant idea if the minimum wage increases to 15/hr?

>What stops retailers from marking all their products up by a flat % to get their cut of the UBI?

Technically, this will probably happen: not because of UBI, but because of the VAT. Just like how the same thing would happen when labor suddenly jumps in price.

>Almost nothing in Yang's proposed plan has shown true protection of citizens from predatory capitalistic techniques. 

I mean, if you look at the big picture his entire ""Human-Centered Capitalism"" idea is just that.

>Not to mention, his technology tax won't even hit the tech giants in their revenue streams / impact their net worth.

No, a VAT would actually hit them pretty hard.

>Meaning... Yang has no desire to fix the insanely fucked up tax codes that got us here. If he's not even willing to address correcting the tax codes such that Bezos can get away with paying nothing in taxes, then what the fuck are we even doing here?

Capitalism what keeps this from happening. Consumers will have a relatively fixed price sensitivity on usual everyday goods. Prices will go up slightly on luxury items because of the VAT, but if you start charging me double for a snickers, I’m gonna go buy a Milky Way that only went up 5-10%.

And yes, all capital, forever, has flowed back into the hands of landlords and bankers, thank you for making my point for me so very well.  We should fix that.  Not by funneling more money into the same system (because that won’t work, for all the reasons I’ve already stated), but by breaking the system.  How do we do that?  Get people educated without plunging them into debt, so that they can get better jobs.  Create better, green energy jobs.  Drive down drug prices and give Medicare to everyone.  That’s what I’m advocating.  And frankly, why are you so worried about the jobs guarantee? It’s not like everyone in the country is suddenly going to switch careers because of it.  There are existing jobs out there, too.  

You can’t just hand out money to everyone and expect that prices for everything aren’t going to go up.  Because landlords and corporations will take that money if it’s available.  Obviously this will not happen overnight.  But over several years, maybe ten or so, prices will have increased enough that we’re back in exactly the same place. 

The best way to fix the income divide is by building the infrastructure to improve people’s lives.  Tax the wealthy, tax corporations, tax estates, whatever, but put that money into the infrastructure to better people’s lives, not into ultra vulnerable checks that go to everyone, the ultra-rich included. This prevents the money back flow by preventing the transfer of money into bankers’ hands when they hand out student loans, and the transfer to insurance companies by eliminating their involvement in healthcare.  Rent will rise at its existing rate, not an artificially inflated one caused by UBI.

I 100% agree with you about wealth inequality in America and how bad it is.

1/3 of millennials went to college and suffered soul crushing debt. Most of these millennials were unable to get high paying jobs or jobs at all. They didn’t get the job not cause of the debt. If we made college free, it’s not like jobs would suddenly appear right?  

Making college free is nice and all, but as you say, it only helps 1/3 of Americans (and likely the richer third). It’s not going to do anything towards more and better paying jobs.

$1,000/month helps everyone, including those who don’t go to college. Especially as the value of a college education goes down (you can literally learn how to code 100% online for free and make six figures), we need to focus on a more forward looking solution that respects the reality of our changing world. 

The freedom dividend would alleviate financial insecurity for millions of Americans, rejuvenate small businesses, and give Americans room to breathe as they figure out how to fit into our future.

It's reminding them they are American as well, it's nothing to them financially so it doesn't increase the income gap, and it's also incredibly helpful so that there's no means testing at all. It would actually cost more money and time most likely to exclude them than to just include them. 

As for it not stacking, I really don't see the problem with it. It's more helpful and more cost effective to do it this way, making it stack adds a ton of other costs and doesn't remove the bureaucratic nightmare, it also would actually encourage what many people claim it does now, if I got the UBI and welfare, why would i work at all? My welfare would go away with practically any job I got and I would be working harder for the same amount. So unless I got a much higher paying job than what those in that position normally can do, it just wouldn't be worth it. 

I'm not against it stacking per se, I just think this weird fight to keep it alive is ignoring that it would help those on it alot. It's worth the trade off. 

Also Yang has shown a willingness to listen to his followers in his policies, if you can show him it would work and work better, he will adapt it.

Nominal GDP will have increased by 13%, which is the total value of output by the country. That will lead to additional revenue for the government every year afterwards on that higher output. But GDP growth, which is the percentage change of nominal GDP from year to year, will slow after 8 years according to the study Yang is citing. Meaning, tax revenue won't increase at that additional growth rate, because GDP is growing at baseline levels. Since tax revenue during those 8 years isn't enough to cover the cost of UBI, and since UBI payments will continue to grow as it is tied to inflation measures of some kind, the deficit caused by the policy will only grow rather than shrink, or at best the deficit will maintain the same rate.

Long story short, there will not be GDP growth of 13% every 8 years past the initial 8 that UBI is introduced. Growth will return to baseline levels, which as I said is likely 2-2.5%. So the timeline would go 2020-2028, GDP growth = 3.6-4.1% annually (best case), 2029-onwards, GDP growth = 2-2.5% annually.

I actually don't know/don't want to spend the time looking at the study if it shows Real GDP or nominal. I would assume real if they are doing their jobs well, but it doesn't really matter at the end of the day. My initial estimate was assuming it was real GDP growth. When I said ""nominal GDP"", I was being lazy and just meant the current year dollar value of GDP. While the base year can change, if the base year is the current year, then nominal GDP = real GDP, i.e. inflation effects are ignored over 1 year period (versus say quarter to quarter or month to month) for comparison purposes to other years. Yes you are right though that I should have probably used real GDP growth, meaning GDP growth after accounting for inflation.

But second and even more importantly, I wasn't talking about inflation at all in regards to growth. I was talking about inflation in regards to increasing the payout of UBI each year. So one can envision a UBI set to inflation, such that year 1 it pays $12k per person eligible, year 2 it pays $12k*(1+percent inflation), year 3 it pays $12k*(1+percent inflation year 1)*(1+percent inflation year 2), etc.

>Lastly, the math you were arguing with actually took an average between tax-funded and non tax-funded estimate so it was using ~8% not 13%.

Yep I saw that. The author of that spreadsheet came up with some estimate on how much would be funded on debt versus higher taxes, then interpolated between the two growth numbers to get an estimated growth projection. Idk how they got the lower end growth number (couldn't find it in the Roosevelt Institute report they reference), so I can't vouch that this is estimated over 8 years too. It probably is though. Likely the real answer will be somewhere between 0% and 1.6% extra growth per year, but I wasn't trying to estimate how much. For the sake of argument I just assumed the best growth, and still showed there is likely about $1 trillion on new deficits with all the changes proposed. And that's the rosiest projection Yang has. So I'm skeptical that his policy is actually fully funded. While that's not necessarily a bad thing, it needs to be stated or explained rather than saying all the proposed policy ideas pay for it.",politics,t2_w70eh18,crblid,exfdks6,/r/politics/comments/crblid/elon_musk_and_andrew_yang_support_universal_basic/exfdks6/,/r/politics/comments/crblid/elon_musk_and_andrew_yang_support_universal_basic/

From the study:

if you look at their chart the vast majority of GDP growth is during those 4 years of implementation. This indicates that the growth is very responsive to the implementation, as it tapers off significantly within a year of being fully implemented. Saying growth will be spread evenly over the 8 years would be far from true.

>**Bartholomew**: To shift gears a little bit, back to the basis of your platform, do you have a philosophy, and who are some people who have influenced you?  
>  
>**Yang**: I certainly studied many of the thinkers during my education, because I studied economics and political science, with a dash of philosophy in college, and I did go to law school so there is a little bit of that sprinkled. So some of the thinkers that influenced me: I think Mill’s idea of utilitarianism really stuck with me, I think Hobbes’s ideas of the state of nature were really powerful and influential. Milton Friedman has been a big influence on me, he’s influenced all of Western economic thought, so he’s someone that I’ve internalized a lot of his thinking. Yeah, so there are a lot of ideas I think I have in common with many libertarians, I believe.  
>  
>**B**: As we move back to [the libertarian perspective on universal basic income,](https://beinglibertarian.com/universal-basic-income/) do you see this replacing welfare programs and the bureaucracy that runs them, or do you see this running largely supplementary?  
>  
>**Y**: I see it as largely replacing welfare programs, and the bureaucracy that administers them, and I think that there are many perverse incentives to the current systems. I think that it is infantilizing to many Americans, and I think that it’s even debilitating, because the disability programs, for example, have the perfect incentives to keep you disabled, because if you feel better, then your benefits got to zero. So right now there is a zero percent churn rate from long-term disability, where no one ever feels better. So I’d want to replace a lot of those programs, we have 126 programs right now, it’s like a patchwork, and no one thinks that it’s working well. So the freedom dividend would replace, hopefully, a lot of that, maybe most of it.  
>  
>**B**: Could you name specifics?  
>  
>**Y**: So the way I’m modeling the freedom dividend is that it’s opt-in, but if you opt in, then you lose any other benefits that you’re getting. So the issue is that because people rely upon different programs for different things, you don’t want to step in and say I’m gonna take it all away from you, because some people are receiving more, some are receiving less, and if they’re relying upon it to that level you could rely destroy someone’s survival mechanism if you were to replace or eliminate programs, so what you do is you say, look, you can make a determination, if you opt in to the freedom dividend, then you lose everything else you’re getting. And you end up substituting for many of those programs because someone would look at it and say, I’m getting $700 worth of food stamps and housing assistance, I’d much prefer a thousand dollars cash. And so then you would end up eliminating many of these programs.",politics,t2_3kk3k,cp3k3y,ewn79o0,/r/politics/comments/cp3k3y/elon_musk_says_he_supports_andrew_yang_for/ewn79o0/,/r/politics/comments/cp3k3y/elon_musk_says_he_supports_andrew_yang_for/

That's why most people who even qualify for welfare don't recieve it. He wants to cut through that bullshit and just help people no questions asked.

That is correct. The amount people get from SNAP is much less than UBI first off. A quick google search gave me this:

""On average, SNAP households received about $253 a month in fiscal year 2018. The average SNAP benefit per person was about $126 per month, which works out to about $1.40 per person per meal.""

I would be suprised if there is a single person on this Earth that would prefer SNAP to an unconditional $1000 a month. Same thing with TANF

You realize the type of argument you are making is what the right does all the time right? Where you are using an unlikely small scenario to stop any sort of progress. ""This phrasing actually means this, which means eventually they will be taking all my guns away"" 

You have listed no facts to support your claims, you have no way of knowing if what you are saying is correct, it's just what you assume will happen. even if, this scenario you are talking about is true, the large majority of people who qualify for welfare don't recieve any because either there is a social stigma about it, they don't wanna jump through the hoops to get it, or they don't even know about it. 

People really don't generally recieve this much from welfare, especially because many programs are based on household income, not even individual. The ONLY time I can see it not helping more is in single parent households which Yang also has ideas how to help.

You can get it via direct deposit, mailed check, or pick it up at a local post office, your choice. It will quite possibly be the least bureaucratic government program to ever exist. This is an exceedingly dumb argument. Which is it? He's a secret libertarian trying to destroy welfare or he's trying to bloat the government? Those two things don't mix. 

You're first quote isn't from me.

Also, you claimed it wouldn't help this on welfare, when I disputed that you came back with Yangs only sample set being the poor..... What? That doesn't even make sense. And for the record, Yang has spoken at length about the benefits to the middle class it would bring in almost every long form interview which I am assuming you've never actually listened to because you seem to have a third or even fourth-hand knowledge of Yangs actual policies.

I already knew about the interview you are talking about. It's Dave Rubin's. I was just trying to see if you even knew the name. People have been smearing the shit out of Yang through this podcast. 


In this interview Andrew Yang was asked if he wanted to get rid of welfare. Yang didn't even answer the question because he knew Rubin wanted to hear a yes. All Andrew Yang said in response was that UBI would cause a reduction in programs like SNAP(which give about half the amount of what UBI gives) and others due to people making a switch on their own. He never said he wanted to get rid of te programs. He just said that people choosing UBI over their current benefits would cause almost the same effect. He doesn't want to snatch anyones money away. If you are on a current benefit and want to keep it, you can. That is not gutting it by any means.

The rule that Elon is alleged to have violated applies, as the article says, if there is a “purchase or sale of a security.”  But for an insider of a company — someone with material nonpublic information like Elon — this is essentially deemed to apply no matter what, since there are always market transactions happening.

But for someone outside the company, it only applies if there are actual purchases or sales in which the person has some interest. It’s preventing fraud. If I lie to you about Microsoft and then sell you Microsoft stock at an inflated price, then I defrauded you. But if I just lie to you about Microsoft, then I just lied. That’s not illegal, unless I am a Microsoft insider and have material nonpublic information.

> So let&#039;s inquire as to why Elon Musk just had to pay a $20 million penalty and step down as Chairperson of Tesla for doing the same thing Donald Trump does constantly.

> The caveat &quot;In connection with the purchase or sale of any security&quot; might seem insulating - Elon himself was not buying any Tesla shares or selling any of his approximately 20 percent stake in connection with the tweet - but even if other people purchase or sell in connection to the statement, this criterion has arguably been checked.

> The gist of why the SEC thought Elon Musk should be liable can be gleaned from their subheadings saying his tweets were &quot;Materially False and Misleading&quot; and that &quot;Musk&#039;s Tweets Caused Market Chaos and Harmed Tesla Investors.&quot; Basically the SEC said &quot;Funding secured&quot; had some basis in reality, but was a bit of an overstatement, and affected the stock price.

Most of Musk followers think he is some sort of a genius - are in fact morons. He is just very good at marketting.As for the tweet.

Musk tweets what he is intending to do with his company and Trump tweets an opinion about other companies.

The difference? One is an opinion and one can be viewed as inside info from CEO himself. Honestly I don't know why I bother because if you couldn't see that difference yourself my post will surely not make you see it.

Yet , I trust TRUTH abides in all spiritually and common good people - while our trust in our liberal democratic institutions are  continually being attacked from all sides by appointed (hired) good people who employ contemporary unwritten policy and tactics unlike the America I volunteered 3 years of life to preserve 1971-1974 . 

&#x200B;

Is This Great Experiment of democratic governance DEAD due to burial of presupposed principals ?

&#x200B;

I have experienced the answer to this , soon it will become self evident to the willfully blinded too .   

&#x200B;

Enjoy our present moments in the drama & theatrics of the participatory last acts against the meaning and sight of Lady Liberty and Lady Justice as rust gathers in our mournful twilight .

Trump aside, this is complete nonsense. Musk’s tweet was the most obvious instance of securities securities fraud I’ve ever seen in real-time. He materially misled investors, which artificially inflated the value of Tesla’s stock, and investors lost a ton of money when the truth was revealed. Open and shut case. 

Musk settled with the SEC for the same reason that the SEC settles the vast majority of enforcement actions: because both sides would rather settle than litigate an open and shut case.

We don't really know anything about his investments, but if he owns securities or is short securities and his positions would benefit from his trade wars or some of the tweets you pointed out, that seems like a violation of the emoluments clause to me.

This isn't the same as a CEO simply making decisions to improve the value of his company while owning shares in said company, because trump is actively making decisions to increase his own wealth at the expense of thousands of other companies.

Abovethelaw is generally written for lawyers, by lawyers. The 10b-5 rule he writes about in this article is fairly well understood by most law students because it's always a potential subject for the bar exam. Thus, it's widely relatable information to anyone who has completed law school. Laymen generally aren't even aware of the regulation's existence and shouldn't be expected to know of it, and so it's understandable that you don't understand what the article is saying. 

Trump's ability to affect the price of a given company's stock has long been questioned as being subject to 10b-5 because only one with a fiduciary duty can be punished under the statute. But the problem, like so many problems with Trump, is that we've never had to question whether the POTUS owes certain fiduciary duties under 10b-5 because no POTUS has ever outright publicly attacked private business the way Trump does. That is, there's no precedent for it. 

Take Musk for example. He's clearly a fiduciary of the Tesla corporation. Thus, there is no doubt he owes fiduciary duties to the company and the investors. I happen to disagree with the author as to Musk because Musk's statements, which certainly consist of inside information, could easily be seen as materially misleading and an attempt to influence stock price to his benefit. And Tesla's stock price was indeed benefitted by those statements, and the case could be made that a person in Musk's position would understand what his tweets could or would do (thus, ""knowingly""). 

The word ""benefit"" is key here. The benefit gained under 10b-5 doesn't have to be monetary. It can simply be a good feeling, a step toward accomplishing a goal that one believes is beneficial, etc. Therefore, if Trump hoped to gain some sort of leverage or advantage in dealing with the companies he's so publicly excoriated by showing he can cause them harm, and if he gained any measure of that, or even just took satisfaction in it, then his actions should be subject to 10b-5.

Generally, the remedy under 10b-5 is disgorgement of all profits gained or losses saved from the violation, hence the large sums both Musk and Tesla had to pay. However, Trump likely didn't financially profit from his Tweets unless he directed others to short the stock prior to his tweets. However, 10b-5 does provides for fines. It also provides for prison time.

So if Trump, as POTUS, is deemed to owe a general fiduciary duty under 10b-5 to American businesses, and it seems unfathomable that he does not, then he should be subject to 10b-5 penalties. 

If you think that was tedious, it was a actually quite a truncated explanation. The writer of the article, being who he is, and knowing the audience he writes for, doesn't have to explain anything more than he did because we already know the rule and its applications he refers to.

He's POTUS, not CEO, and being a politician doesn't mean he suddenly has access to the financials and business decisions of corporations. 

In fact, it's illegal for the POTUS to exert control over private-sector business.

He's unrelated to these companies he's commenting on, and doesn't posses any special information or influence.

Even if the release was TRUE, it was still a violation as “material information” must be released to the public thru official investor channels. As a CEO of a public company even side jokes are taken VERY seriously. He’s been part of other companies, he knows this. 

Trump is a different kind of problem. He’s making public statements as President about things like telling USPS to review their contracts with Amazon. He’s basically using his position as President to bump Amazon’s stock for a day to get back at Bezos. It’s probably happened before, but never so brazenly.   Ironically most government agencies have strict rules for Employees and Contractors that are strictly enforced about using positions to influence the public or conflicts of interest. (As Trump was so glad to point out the two agents at the FBI). Elected officials and Cabinet members have no such restrictions as they’re not employees. They can and do use their position to smear companies all the time, and there’s no law against them smearing to line their pockets. 

Trump is teaching everyone there a lot more rules we need to make when he’s done. If Political Parties aren’t going to hold officials to ethics then we need laws to do so.

It would not immediately make you guilty of a crime. However, if you worked IN Amazon and presumably had insider info and made that tweet, then you might get a knock on the door by the SEC.

That's where the problem lies. I don't think Trump directly violates the rule as he doesn't actually have insider knowledge of individual companies (I think). But he does have direct insider knowledge of proposed tariffs (as he's the one who pretty much signs them) and if he tweets something like ""Lol don't buy Apple stock for a week"" and then tomorrow the WH reveals some significant tariffs that will affect Apple, THEN we have a problem.

He made a statement that he knew at the time was wrong. A “going private” deal mostly is dependent on one thing — getting your hands on an insane amount of cash. Saying “we are considering going private and are in discussions about funding” is vastly different from “funding secured.” One means that the only real hurdle to doing a deal has not been met, and the other means it has. Also, a price wouldn’t normally be set until the buyback is launched. If someone says “funding secured” and gives a price, then basically that means “it’s all ready, just need to pull the trigger.”

No securities lawyer I’ve ever worked with would think that his tweet was okay. It was putting wild misinformation into the market. It’s exactly what the laws are meant to prevent. Intent to defraud is irrelevant — the intent that is needed is intentionally making the illegal statement.

That said, my suspicion is that he said this to cause a stock price increase that would inflict pain on short-sellers, and maybe cause them liquidity problems as they face margin calls to cover their shorts. There really is no business reason to do this — if anything, it gives the proposed lenders bargaining power because you’ve already announced that you got the funding.

noun

a place where large numbers of people, especially political prisoners or members of persecuted minorities, are deliberately imprisoned in a relatively small area with inadequate facilities, sometimes to provide forced labor or to await mass execution. The term is most strongly associated with the several hundred camps established by the Nazis in Germany and occupied Europe in 1933–45, among the most infamous being Dachau, Belsen, and Auschwitz.

> Also, regarding the truth. Musk wasn't. When you say ""funding secured"" the expectation is that there's a concrete agreement. Not a few talks. If Musk wasn't lying, then he would have turned around to the SEC and go ""Look, here see. I have all an agreement from X that we will do Y."".

Edit: The SEC started by asking Musk to clarify what he meant by ""funding secured"". Clearly, what they heard back was enough for (1) SEC to sue and (2) Musk to pay.

So when Walmart and Amazon business dips then people might use Trump's business which results in profit for Trump. So he is using his influence as a public official to change people's opinions and where their money goes to help his own business~~.

Sanders doesn't own any competing businesses.

Edit: thought Trump's steaks were still in production since that would compete with steaks Walmart sells. Nevermind I was wrong.

Maybe they think that if that government will ease it’s tax burden, they can do better for themselves because they believe in their own merit, they believe they can be successful on the fruits of their labor, when those fruits are not first picked over by the IRS and given to causes that do not help them, because they are the type to take care of themselves anyways. Maybe those people believe in you and I in the same manner, that you can create your own way, as can I. We have a better chance at doing so if so much money didn’t come out of our pockets to go to other people, sometimes in other countries, but very often to waste. You make the assumption that all Republicans vote that way because they want to be rich and have slaves. When in reality, they were just tired of Democrat fascism. I’m not saying that dems we’re beating people in the streets, but the over regulation and glut of the federal government were controlling our lives. From insurance premiums becoming mandated and prices tripling, to the overregulation of business making it hard to compete on a global scale, to the targeting of certain groups with the IRS. Then you have the culture war that has been going on between our groups for some time now. Conservatives were not ready for the feel good war on biology and pushing transgenders on our school children. They were tired of seeing Islam embraced and called peaceful when we see them blowing themselves up, knife/grenade/acid attacking and suicide bombing and Christians being considered worse because of their belief in abortion and homosexuality. This isn’t a republican get rich quick scheme. This is Republicans being tired of Dem financial regulation. This is Republicans seeing through the Marxism and not being kept quiet by PC crap anymore.

You clearly have no idea what you're talking about because corporations could always have contracts. Seriously, I think you think that's what that really means. There is a lot more implication that a conglomeration of people is considered legally speaking a person. English is difficult to represent legally because the very definition of some words change. Disney is now equally speaking the same as an LLC that your buddy opened up in his garage to fix cars and make some extra money. It used to be stuff would go to public domain after so many years after the artist's death. Mickey Mouse will now forever be owned by Disney. The only reason you can paint Mickey Mouse on a children's hospital wall is because Disney won't sue them, but they can. 

Anyways, we were talking about how the president of the United States repeatedly talks about businesses. It's a shame, but I will actually admit he might be the only person legally who can surmise on businesses legally and if it affects their stock, it doesn't matter. He shouldn't attack a business nor plug his daughter's clothes on a public platform, but doing what Elon musk did isn't illegal for the president. He can declassify classified information and most of these corporations are publically traded. Now, if he signed a contract with the company, which, again, they have been doing since as long as shit has been written down, then that's a whole different matter.

If that's the case, I really don't see how it's surprising or bad for Musk to donate this sort of money to Republicans. If I had money, I'd also want to bid on their politicians simply because they are the majority party controlling everything, so having control over their politicians is better than any other party politicians.

One can argue if legal corruption like that is a good thing, but at this point that seems to be the way American politics works, so I don't really see how one can fault Musk for playing along.

Basically, bribing politicians doesn't mean you support what they are doing now. It means you want them to change their course somehow, and unless you know how Elon Musk uses this bought influence, you can't really tell if Musk wanted to see more kids in cages or if he tries to get impeachment movement going within the Republican party. Either of those is a possibility, and just saying ""he donated"" doesn't tell you which of the two he had as his goals.",politics,t2_qjh3s,8zpxh9,e2ld3g4,/r/politics/comments/8zpxh9/elon_musk_has_donated_nearly_7_times_as_much_to/e2ld3g4/,/r/politics/comments/8zpxh9/elon_musk_has_donated_nearly_7_times_as_much_to/

Fact is, he's an arch-capitalist, and most likely some sort of libertarian asshole if you had to put him in a category.

If you say 'sure, spacex needs government business, but Tesla sells to individual citizens', remember that the government funds Tesla on the other side: Subsidies for renewables, loans to get it off the ground in the first place.
