Exxon agreed to a settlement to pay each family who lost their entire livelihood something like $1.4 million, which is fucking weak for an entire commercial fishing career.  However, they dragged it out in court for 25 fucking years, spending WAY more than paying the families, in order to whittle it down to, when they finally paid out, 80 fucking thousand dollars.  Long before that my dad already was in a deep depression, alcoholism, and my mom divorced him. By the time they paid out he didn't live anywhere, traveling around doing nothing, and he split the payout between my brother and I.

Literally anybody who is as smart as Elon Musk realized early in trump's campaign that there was no way trump was going to listen to reason if he won. So Elon's choice was either to resist trump and push for rational policies outside of federal government, or to join trump's advisory team and keep on hammering trump with reason, until trump cracked or left the presidency. Even if Musk gave trump the benefit of the doubt at first, trump obliterated any notion that he would implement reasonable environmental policy as soon as he reversed the Stream Protection Rule in the first few weeks of his presidency.

The Stream Protection Rule exists for a good reason. And that reason is that when coal mining companies dump huge amounts of formerly-underground rock into streams, they are literally introducing toxic metals into the water, which negatively affect practically every living thing that the stream touches, including humans who get drinking water from the stream or any rivers it feeds. It may create a bit of extra work from the coal companies, but so fucking what? Extra work is nothing compared to the damage that comes from heavy metal pollution from unregulated coal mines.

Either the coal companies pony up a few million dollars a year to improve their dumping practices now, or the government is forced to spend billions of dollars a year for decades afterwards to treat the symptoms of heavy metal pollution in the people and the environment. There is ONLY one correct choice in that scenario, both morally and economically. I know that, you know that and Musk sure as fuck knows that, but trump went ahead and picked the wrong choice anyway. If Musk had any faith in trump's environmental policy after that moment, he's an idiot. That was the moment when Musk had to decide between leaving trump's advisory board, or staying there for he long run.",politics,t2_4vuia,6epe74,dice6nx,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/dice6nx/,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/

What sort of nonsense response is that to my comment about a guy who has:

- received ~$5 billion in government subsidies to grow his empire of companies that exist merely to exploit state tax codes to continue receiving more and more tax payer money
- attacked employees right to collectively bargain
- worked with the dumbest, fattest President to hopefully further enrich himself.

He supposedly took a ""bold stand"" today with Trump's decision on the Paris Accord? Vicious racism and policy coming from the White House since January 20th weren't enough to get him to step down from the advisory counsel?

He's a grifter. He is grifting the government and us the taxpayers to fund his company while his stocks soar, and was hoping to use his advisory position to continue to enhance his grifting operation. 

Once again, there are no good billionaires. Billionaires should absolutely not exist. We live in the most plentiful time in human history, yet a handful of people own more wealth than half of the rest of the world combined, and because of it billions all around the world suffer starvation, poverty, and death.

Customer service, cashiers, data entry, banking associates, farm labor, etc... Just about every industry is exploring massive changes as a result of automation.

We are at the precipice of a paradigm shift in terms of automation. Very large industries are at the point where they are going to be able to save themselves a ton of cash replacing workers with automated counterparts. Sure, industries have dealt with automation and technological advances before, but never on this type of scale. We're talking about huge percentages of the workforce that can be replaced in a very short amount of time. It's simply not feasible to reabsorb those types of numbers. There are going to be a lot of people who are simply going to be unnecessary and the industries that pop up are going to explore automation from the start.

These aren't freeloaders. They aren't leeches on the system. They want to work, they are just going to have obsolete skill sets facing a marketplace that's doing its damnedest to remove actual people from the equation.

If industry is exploring ways to mass automate, the government needs to be exploring ways to accommodate a labor force in a marketplace with no need for manual labor.

If you think it's CO2 levels, you're mistaken. It's really not obvious. I actually dug into this a while back and I hope that for your own peace of mind, you'll do the same. It became clear to me that there is no ""consensus"" (as we hear so often) in the scientific community regarding this phenomenon.   
  
I've seen data showing our CO2 levels 10 times as high as today during an ice age, and CO2 levels 4 times as high as today during human habitation of the planet. I've also seen charts that prove temperature and CO2 may be correlated, but in the opposite direction suggested by popular theory. As in, temperature rises first, CO2 levels go up after. The popular idea of causation is backwards, if there's any causation at all. And I've heard that atmospheric temperature change due to CO2 is logarithmic. It can't spiral out of control because it will take exponentially greater carbon emissions for each degree of global temperature change. I've heard that cloud activity contributes more to the rise and fall of global temperatures than carbon emission, and that's where some scientists are investigating.  
  
There's a lot more to it, but I guess what I'm saying is that you shouldn't be so confident that the cause is known.

He didn't think them up. He bought out the people who created them. Actually, he pretty much stole Tesla. He's not a self-made anything. He's a total fake, down to his toupee and his crazy lying girlfriend. SpaceX is a secret government project. They knew the taxpayers wouldn't support it, so they hide the funds inside the space program, when they're really helping him develop weapons. How do you think he got permission to dock with the Space Station? He's a government pawn, and once Trump cancels all his projects, he will be bust. He literally stole Tesla from it's original owner. Everybody knows that. He's a scumbag in love with a gold digger. Yeah, great guy. You can tell that by how he screwed his first wife and mother of their six (one died) kids, making her sign a ""post nup"" once PayPal started doing well that left her with next to nothing to take care of their children.

All his money, BTW, is in a trust and he lives on an allowance, because most of the money belongs to the government, not him.

Plenty more about all this in Wikipedia. If it wasn't true, he could have hired someone to go in and change it. 

>In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million from the sale of Zip2.[42][50][52] One year later, the company merged with Confinity,[51][54] which had a money transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.

In other words, it's a renewable energy paradise — and today the Central American nation is moving quickly to become a green energy powerhouse. Within a few years the vast majority of Nicaragua's electricity will come from hydroelectric dams, geothermal plants and wind farms.

The reason they didn't join the Paris Climate Accord:

> In the case of Nicaragua, the argument actually went the other way. As world leaders gathered in the French capital in November 2015 to reach an agreement on fighting climate change, Nicaragua's lead envoy explained to reporters that the country would not support the agreed-upon plan as it hinged on voluntary pledges and would not punish those who failed to meet them. That was simply not enough, Paul Oquist argued.

>  “We’re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure,” Oquist told the website Climate Home on Nov. 30. “We don’t want to be an accomplice to taking the world to 3 to 4 degrees and the death and destruction that represents.”

On the morning of 12 September 1973, Jara was taken prisoner, along with thousands of others, and interned in Chile Stadium.

I don't know where you got that misinformation on Reagan-era Nicaragua but it was NOT ""chill"".  The real McCoy communists who filtered into Nicaragua during that revolution killed a lot of innocent people and later attempted to destabilize the rest of Central America through similarly violent upheaval.  You have no idea who and what you slapped a halo on there.

I'm not suggesting that Nicaragua's former President and his inner circle were choir boys.  They weren't.  They definitely deserved to be overthrown.  Instead, I'm pointing out that many of the Communist radicals found in Nicaragua were as bad if not worse in many instances.  Sandinistas screwed the Nicaraguan people too.  I take it you were unaware that Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega also pilfered from that country's treasury.  Here's [Ortega's boomerang ""evolution"" into the very autocrats he fought to replace](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/4/daniel-ortega-is-a-sandinista-in-name-only.html).

BTW, I'm no Reagan fan, but he was correct to take on the Communists who attempted to destabilize Central and South America.  I've seen what communist revolutionaries are capable of doing.  Would you like a peek?  Look no further than what they're doing to the people of Venezuela in their equally blind and self-serving lust for power.

Explain, because if it means that average temperatures would be a fraction of a degree less than they are today in 100 years... Then that's a massive massive win, because they're predicted to be much much more in 100 years if we continue doing what we're doing.

As far as Trump's arguments, none of them really hold any water. On the one hand you have the fact that the renewable energy sector is growing at such a rapid pace, I haven't looked up numbers but it wouldn't surprise me if it outpaced whatever estimates Trump's talking points are relying on, especially as investment continues to increase. Then on the other hand you have the fact that this whole thing was voluntary and had zero consequences attached to not meeting the *voluntary* goals that the country set *for itself*.

now, do you have any supporting creds to back up claims?

How does/will Paris Accord hurt the country - on the one hand turmpists claim it is toothless and not worth participating in, on the other there appears to be  a continget that that believes it, ( the PA ) is killing jobs and maybe making the US weaker... or costing too much... REally, this line of though is fuzzy at best, maybe on purpose...

Next question would be job loss, some site 2.7 million. Really, whre is that coming from? From my view, new jobs are and will be created that focus on new tech/energy. And over time that/those will only grow if they are successfull. HOw is that not the american way. cheat answer - it is the american way.

Not signing up the the PA puts the US in a position of isolationism, and foolishnes. THe PA is hardly constricting in it's requirments,  it's an 'agreement' for fs. 

When playing the game, being at the table is one of the most important positions. Taking toys home and saying no, leveing the rest of the worlld at the table is just foolish.

We all know the PA is somewhat pointless, but still it is not. That's what makes it great, it 's a start on the road, and everyone needs a truck on that road....

Going it alone is foolish, how many times can I sy this.. Just gets tiring. Goining it along works for loners in the woods, not nations, sitting at a table.

One of the primary reasons is that **the deal is not binding** — in other words, **there are no punishments** for countries that fail to live up to the commitments they make as part of the deal [...] Oquist also objected to the agreed-upon goal of **limiting the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius**, noting that the emissions targets, as well as the voluntary nature of the agreement, **would likely result in increases of more like 3 or 4 degrees Celsius** [...] ""It’s a matter of the developing countries surviving.

The national security implications of climate change alone should be reason enough to support the Paris agreement.

To be fair, Putin has more direct dealings with Muslim populations and neighbors and learned a lot of the psychology of terrorism.  Distance-learning, and the draw of fast exciting events by the media-addicted American public.

We've let ourselves stay in a State of Emergency for 16 years, and Trump's first big play in office was to go after the Muslims via airport closure and visa revocations. Clearly Trump thinks being scared and Fear is the way to deal with the Islam problems the world is having.

Conservative Muslims and Conservative Communists are very good at defeating the moral of liberal arts and free thinking.  They understand just how powerful it is to emphasize short-term reaction in the minds of the people.

He campaigned on climate denial, he put climate denialists in charge of the EPA, he's part of the Republican party.

As for no good billionaires, I think that's a bit of a hasty generalization. I would agree with you for 99% of them because they have all this money and power but are either completely useless or corrupt. Musk is a 1%. Yes, he does have a very privileged existence but keep in mind he started a couple companies prior to the grant. He demonstrated merit and was rewarded for it and rather than just hermit up or try to take control, he's using that money to keep innovating. In the current societal climate where personal responsibility is replaced with blaming others for one's problems, he continues to try and improve where he can.

Take Tesla, for example. He took a grant to make a limited number of cars and said within a set number of years the money made would be put towards a newer, better, and more affordable car. He did it, and then made the same plan for another line which is set to cone out this year. The initial Tesla S came out at 90k and the upcoming model is supposed to be a top of the line electric car for 30k. Compare that to economy electric cars by other companies and it's still much cheaper. 

Yes, he does take steps to increase profit, but he also uses that money to innovate which is something we as a race drastically need.

I understand healthcare is different, and that some people are born with illnesses out of their control. And I do feel bad for them. At the same time, its not fair to me or insurance companies to be forced to pay for their medical care. Sometimes people are born unlucky.

Now, if charities that are subsidized by the government are set up to help these people, thats something I'd get behind (and support). Others helping others *voluntarily* is a good thing.

This agreement is literally a foreign exchange brokerage of ""futures of pollution"" instead of ""futures of delivery of commodities"", forcing America and the European countries respective companies to have to pay for the right to pollute, thus acting as  tax. Mind you, a tax that they could easily avoid by outsourcing to third world countries.

This agreement was and is a mechanism that incentivuze companies to outsource, and create EVEN MORE pollution than what they would create in the host country. 

Do you want to lose American jobs to Mexico, while bringing the pollution to Mexico too?

It doesn't address pollution, and in an ironic sense it outsources pollution to poor countries that have less of a chance at avoiding it or cleaning it up later. 

Is that what you want? Have you read any fair criticism of it yet? No, you haven't. You don't have time to, and your selected media isn't showing it to you. If they do, they would not do a decent job at criticising it because that would offend or hurt their own audience.

If you want to put African Americans out of work, pollute countries so poor and unable to maintain themselves, thus allowing the world to rot even further, then you are a racist liberal who virtue signals instead if thinks, who yells instead of reads, and your own policies hurt the people you pretend to care so much about: yourself.",politics,t2_4vuia,6epe74,dicbm85,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/dicbm85/,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/

And since you haven't been paying attention to energy markets for the last several years, allow me to explain that regulation isn't prohibiting oil production.

That's because OPEC has kept production high, in order to drive down the price of oil to make it harder for American producers to compete.  American oil is more expensive to recover - not because of regulation, but because the drilling & recovery processes required to get it out of the ground make it more expensive to produce than Saudi oil.

That was simply not enough, Paul Oquist argued.

> so they've done really fucking well, considering what they've been put through by us.

this is basically the story of Latin America -- exploited for centuries by European nations as colonies, then after gaining independence, turned over to US/western-backed puppet dictators who refused to nationalize industries or institute economic reforms to allow American/western companies to continue to exploit their natural resources. 

It's why Cuba is the thorn in the side of imperialism/colonialism -- Castro (whatever his faults re: political prisoners and suppression of dissenters) successfully kept a country fed, clothed, and educated without any real material support from allies, on an island nation isolated from its closest neighboring mainland. While other Latin American nations may have fared better or worse with socialism (Venezuela is a notable failure due to Chavez's cult of personality, but Bolivia and Uruguay stand out as well-functioning democracies with significant numbers of leftists/socialists in government, and somehow that never gets much press in the States), but it cannot be argued that repressive, right-wing governments in Latin America have any better track record, e.g., Pinochet or Peron.

Not that climate change is real but that this agreement favors other countries who have been doing wrong for longer when it comes to emissions and what not way and basically acutally hurts us moneywise.

People want to talk shit but I bet his reasons aren't horrible.  I bet once they begin to come out people will see the rational side to things and understand that Obama didn't care and just wanted to look cool and awesome to younger generations rather than fighting for his countrymen.

So basically this is going to play out over a lot longer time and I can't wait to see what the reasoning he has behind everything and if any are valid.  I am betting some will be but it won't matter on the hate subs like politics and what not but I would like to know the reasons from a non partisan website and everyone seems to throw opinions in nowadays on their articles and I am over it.

Yeah, the wife of a former president just randomly popped up out of a population of 300 million right?

Hillary started her political influence and political career under Bill Clintons presidency, just like Trumps relatives have. She has been using the Clinton brand for everything it's worth.

The leaks from the Democratic party with regards to excluding Bernie do not show any illegalities.

However they do reveal a significant amount of cronyism and shows very clearly that the Democrats are indeed a closed club who want to use their ticket to 50% of the American democracy for their internal purposes. They are not interested in a fair, democratic process including people who have not climbed the internal ladders of the Democrats.

In reality that means that the internal hierarchy of the Democrats ""owns"" 50% of the American democracy, more or less.

**USA:** 26-28% domestic reduction in greenhouse gases by 2025 compared to 2005, making its best effort to reach the 28% target. This includes the land sector and excludes international credits at this time. Carbon Brief has a more detailed article on the US INDC.


**China:**  A peak in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, with best efforts to peak earlier. China has also pledged to source 20% of its energy from low-carbon sources by 2030 and to cut emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65% of 2005 levels by 2030, potentially putting it on course to peak by 2027.


**India:** A 33-35% reduction in emissions intensity by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. Also pledges to achieve 40% of cumulative electricity installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based resources by 2030. Will also increase tree cover, creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2030. India intends to cover the $2.5 trillion cost of its pledge with both domestic and international funds. Includes information on adaptation.

Never forget that trump made a conscious choice to increase the levels of heavy metal pollution from coal mining, just so that coal companies can make a slightly higher profit and maybe employ a few more people. The number of people employed by the coal mining industry in the US went from nearly a million in 1920 to 80,000 today, and the vast majority of that decline happened long before any significant environmental regulations were enacted. And yet a moronic fuckhole like trump has the gall to confidently state that he's going to bring back the coal jobs by repealing regulations.

I can't help but be cynical about Musk's motivation for leaving the advisory panel now. If he truly thought he could talk sense into trump about environmental policy, he was definitively proven wrong in February. So his choice was to leave the advisory panel at that point, or to stay in it for the long haul, and keep on trying to beat sense into trump's thick head until trump left the presidency. Instead of making either of those choices, Musk decided to stay on the panel until trump inevitably decided to withdraw from the Paris Accord, which maximized the good PR he could get by announcing that he would leave.

Do you even realize the stupidity of ""scientific conspiracy"" claims when you try to apply them to entire fields of data-driven science? There are thousands upon thousands of climate scientists all over the world who agree that anthropogenic climate change is real and a big concern. The vast majority of them are not wealthy, and never will be. Many of them could actually make more money and have more stable jobs if they leave climate science and go into other fields that they are qualified in.

I know it might seem quaint, but at the most fundamental level, science is the search for objective truth, and it is by far the most rigorous method for doing so. People who dedicate their lives to esoteric, data-driven science are not the type of people who would sell their souls for an unstable, low-paying job like the kind they get as a climate scientist.

There's plenty of evidence that ""foreign economic policy"" wasn't a major factor in post-independence economic performance, at least for Brazil. Too bad my references are all in Portuguese, but I can show them anyway.

> It's why Cuba is the thorn in the side of imperialism/colonialism -- Castro (whatever his faults re: political prisoners and suppression of dissenters) successfully kept a country fed, clothed, and educated without any real material support from allies, on an island nation isolated from its closest neighboring mainland.

False in two different ways: Cuba was already by far the richest Latin American country before the Revolution. Castro destroyed the sugar industry and started to rely on USSR grants instead. After the USSR collapsed, well, Cuba almost collapsed (this is directly connected to the Balseros crisis) and from that day on the country has terrible, terrible standards of living, living on small grants from other left-wing Latin American governments.

> Bolivia and Uruguay stand out as well-functioning democracies with significant numbers of leftists/socialists in government

Completely different models. Bolivia (and especially Ecuador, for that matter) are Venezuelan puppets. They're just as poor as they were before those governments took over. Uruguay is a pretty well-managed Social Democracy with little formal/ideological ties to Venezuela.

> but it cannot be argued that repressive, right-wing governments in Latin America have any better track record, e.g., Pinochet or Peron.

Perón wasn't even close to being right-wing. His party was named ""Justicialista"" after ""Social Justice"". He's one of the worst socialist-ish authoritarian Latin American presidents you can find, together with scum like Chávez, Vargas and Allende - all democratically ""elected"" (Vargas was a dictator for more that 13 years and Allende was only elected because Chile had no 2nd round mechanism back then, but anyway), all authoritarian hijos de puta.",politics,t2_4vuia,6epe74,dichj4q,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/dichj4q/,/r/politics/comments/6epe74/elon_musk_quits_trumps_advisory_councils_after/

Obviously natural gas isn't great, especially compared to some places out west where wind or hydro is Dominion's renewable option.

But you can also do this by shifting money from other programs such as military spending rather than a much needed climate change program. I agree that its not convenient that we have to fund so much money, but ultimately we are doing it for the sake of global health and for humanitarian reasons. 

My concern is the consequences of not joining this agreement. The climate change agreement also insists on a climate tax in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. With the EPA losing control and with the U.S. pulling out of the climate agreement, there are far less regulations on business pollution. We have a firsthand example of what happens when business pollution gets out of hand (China).

This all sounds great if you're thinking about today only, and today's climate topic.  

But as a general rule that the politicians (and by extension, government and citizens) should just obey scientists is an idea that's also fraught with risks.

Science, including ""consensus"" science, is sometimes wrong or incomplete.  Further, science as an industry is comingled with economic and industrial and corporate interests and money. 

Imagine the same rule being applied in the mid-20th century when doctors were endorsing certain brands of cigarettes.  Should the politicians/people just obey whatever Monsanto's staff of well-compensated scientists tell us?  

There should be checks and balances both ways, and merely saying that politicians/civilians should always take their orders from scientists isn't balanced.

Don't get me wrong, I despise Trump, but I'm sick of seeing liberals rally behind awful people they should oppose. A lot of these people aren't against Trump because of ethical reasons; they're against him because he harms their political or economic interests.

No other country will take a hit like that and most will actually receive benefits from the agreement compared to us.

How is that fair?  We kept out population low.  We aren't the sole cause.

Nations going through their theoretical industrial revolutions(170-200 years late) while the population is doubling from 3.5 bil to 7 billion is the reason for this.  More people being born are the reason for this.  Keeping up with demand to meet all of the new mouths in countries with shit populations and out of control numbers are the reason.

This is like cancelling the TPP.  Once people start to do actual research and see it for more than Ah Trump do something We no like when Trump do anything good or bad.  We yell now.  It will get better.

Hillary didn't just randomly get ""chosen"" as the best of hundreds of million people as the Democrat candidate.

You can of course argue that she at least worked hard for it, but on the other hand, Hillary actually became the Democrat presidential candidate, which despite the ""slightly lesser amount of nepotism"" is still very serious.

Survey data says your anecdotal evidence is wrong.

Interestingly enough, catholic seems to have no bias either way. Protestants are more likely(relative to the population) to be republican, and mormons and evangelical protestants lean heavily towards being protestants, while most other religions are all more likely to lean dem, with jehovahs witnesses as an interesting anomaly that tend to have no preference(guessing it must be part of their beliefs or something?)

GOPers also have the smallest proportion of people who ""do not believe in god""(so atheist)

edit: oh man, the more I read this survey the more fun it is. Definitely check out the whole thing.

Furthermore, pulling out of this agreement has the potential to spark a trade tax. If other nations charge a carbon tax on U.S. energy exports such as coal, this will negatively affect our GDP.

Technology regarding renewable energy has been steadily improving while also lowering the cost of switching to renewable energy. While at the present moment, it may be more expensive to switch, I think the benefits of environmental health outweigh the costs in the long run. I am not saying that every family needs to switch to renewable energy because I understand the financial constraints. However, the carbon emissions limit and tax implied in the agreement if primarily aimed at businesses and I believe that  businesses could definitely make use of renewable energy more.

1. make the US a world leader in the cutting-edge green energy production market

2. reduce its reliance on foreign energy (oil!), thereby making America more self-reliant

3. stabilize the Middle East by reducing outside economic interests/pressure (said oil!)

4. put pressure on *certain* oil-wealthy enablers of terrorism and frequent human rights violators

5. hit the economy of a certain oil-dependent geopolitical rival by lowering the demand/price of oil

6. reduce and stabilize America's long-term energy costs by relying on sustainable energy

7. create thousands (millions?) of jobs in a whole new green energy industry that is sure to last

Its silly and hypocritical only if you were completely unable to parse out my point. I asked you what dictator supported by the US since the fall of saddam is worse than saddam. I asked this because Saddam was arguably the worst dictator the US has ever supported, and his crimes have been unmatched by any US supported regime since.

In other words, you seem to have taken my critical analysis of how bad saddam was in comparison to other us supported regimes as some kind of blanket defense of us foreign policy in general. Take another read at my two other comments and ask yourself if that is even implied.

Castillo Armas, guilty of genocide and killing hundreds of thousands of Guatamalans

El Salvador, 70000 killed by US backed and trained govt forces

Syngman Rhee, South Korea, instilled against the will of the people, liked 100000+ dissenters and arguably partially responsible for the Korean War

Killed half a million Cambodians in illegal bombings to help pave the way for the Khmer Rouge, who ended up killing two million Cambodians people. After communist Vietnam drove them out (a nation that just had millions of its citizens killed by the US for trying to overthrow a western backed colonial oppressor...) The US continued to provide aid to the soldiers responsible afterwards, trained them in laying the millions of land mines that still kill and maim people today. 

Then look at the destabilising done in Syria and Libya, every African nation that moves towards stability, the funding of Pakistan Turkey and Saudi, the world's biggest sponsors of terrorism. The Mexican cartels, the heroin trade in Afghanistan and across the world.

2382,bgkv,https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-unmasked-as-top-donor-to-house-republican-pac,"Lots of people in this thread saying this means Musk is fraudulent/hypocritical, which seems off. He has consistently stated that he does stuff like this out of a hope that those politicians will listen to him later on environmental issues. 

It seems totally reasonable to criticize him for donating to causes he disagrees with (in the same way that there was public pressure to get off of Trump's advisory councils), because it's not obvious that his method has any chance of success. But that's a disagreement over methods, not values. 

His publicly stated values w.r.t. environmentalism are:
> [Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/870369915894546432)

why the fuck are u donating to ppl that don’t believe in climate change and are separating kids from their families then - twitter

> [So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1018268378962640896)

>To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent & politically moderate. Doesn’t mean I’m moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me & I don’t understand why they are not important to everyone.
>[A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1018290544986845184)

There have got to be better topics of debate than whether @elonmusk is committed to climate action. He has dedicated his career to the mission of replacing fossil fuels with clean energy & has strongly backed the Sierra Club's advocacy work. We are proud to have his support. - @SierraClub
>[Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1018321524728610817)

Are you ANY kind of donor to the GOP? - twitter
>[Yes, about 0.5% of what I donated to @SierraClub, which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1018333202140680192)

In short, he's about as environmentally progressive as you would expect from someone who poured his fortune into solar panels, electric cars, and reusable rockets. But not taking a strong anti-GOP stance on all issues, because of some combination of *a)* optimism about being able to influence the administration as a moderate and *b)* self-interest (since SpaceX benefits from a lot of government projects).

There are plenty of fruitful avenues of critique towards Musk (ruthless towards employees and associates, ""elon time"" delivery dates, easily agitated/defensive on twitter).

2398,lemon900098,https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-unmasked-as-top-donor-to-house-republican-pac,"Call me paranoid, but the super-aggressive rhetoric and hatred in /r/politics has gotten a lot worse since the indictments on friday. The one piece of new information we got was about the republican candidate asking Guciffer for info. All of the other information we already knew. The article from a year ago about the dutch having access to the Russian computers already told us that Russia hacked US systems. Guccifer being russian we knew, Stone talking with guccifer we knew. 

I think most republicans in government at this point don't deserve any kind of support, and quite a lot of them should be kicked from office, or even jailed. But since friday that kind of thinking is now seemingly mild compared to a lot of commentators. The hatred has really been kicked up a notch, and I don't think the response is proportionate to what has happened. 

From 2016:

>[Today's Russia is having the opposite effect, dividing many Republicans and Democrats and illustrating the larger breakdown of a national consensus on major foreign policy questions.](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/12/12/505252184/how-russia-went-from-uniting-to-dividing-u-s-politics)

What I'm trying to say, to any Americans in this thread, is that perhaps the thing that Russia did in 2016 and hasn't stopped doing, they are still doing, and might have even kicked it up a notch since friday. Also from friday:

>[Coats said Friday that intelligence officials have seen ""aggressive attempts to manipulate social media and to spread propaganda focused on hot-button issues that are intended to exacerbate social, political divisions.""](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/14/politics/director-of-national-intelligence-dan-coats-cyberattacks-russia/index.html)",politics,t2_qkaot,8yvtcb,e2edyll,/r/politics/comments/8yvtcb/elon_musk_big_gop_donor/e2edyll/,/r/politics/comments/8yvtcb/elon_musk_big_gop_donor/

Elon's no sinless saint, but neither is he a man of evil. He wants to do good for the world, but also wants to well for himself.

The results are: 

(D) $171,750

(R) $334,600 **If** you include his $38,900 donation that is currently processing by the FCC placed 06/05/2018 [linked here.](https://mobile.twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1018172506472112128). If you don’t include it and only include the numbers we can verify on open secrets, then he has only donated $295,700 to Republicans.

Copied from [another user](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8yvtcb/elon_musk_big_gop_donor/e2e3w82/) to clarify further:


Since September 2015 he has donated the following:

 • $10,800 to Dianne Feinstein (D)
 • $7500 to the DNC
 • $15,000 to the SpaceX Super PAC
 • $5,400 to Kevin McCarthy (R)
 • $44,600 to the RNC

https://www.opensecrets.org/donor-lookup/results?name=musk%2C+elon

Further Edit:
Of the SpaceX Super PAC contributions to candidates ($196,000) approximately 42% went to Democrats, 58% to Republicans.
Additionally they have donated $30,000 to the RNC and $10,000 to the DNC.

https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00411116&cycle=2018

$110,620 to (D) and $193,680 to (R).

As I find more sources I’ll edit the numbers.

Martin recommended replacing himself as CEO months before he was demoted. Martin was kept out of the loop *by the board* during the decision to replace him (he says not a single board member told him what was discussed, that says something to me...) -- after the quest to find a replacement CEO was unfruitful. Martin wasn't replaced by Musk, he was replaced with Michael Marks. The *board* chose to replace Martin -- sure, Musk probably had a lot of sway.

To be frank, with as much as Elon had invested into Tesla at that point, I don't blame him for using his power to  attempt to move the company forward with or without the founders -- if that's what happened. Fact of the matter is, even if that is what happened, it doesn't make Musk a scumbag by default unless you consider protecting your investment being a scumbag

I'm sure there are many worse stories out there that show Musk in a bad light (I wonder moreover why everyone is trying to show him in a bad light all of the sudden? Who cares? What changed?), but this shit here is straight business.

Edit: and also, to make it sound like Musk was some distant businessman that swooped in after success was guaranteed to claim the title of founder isn't founded.

He donates to both.  You're being called childish because this is literally how government has always worked and seem to be just 'seeing' it for the first time and are shocked.  Anyone that has been around is not surprised by this.

Now if you want to boycott any business that donates to an R, then that's your right - but its not gonna change the system.  The Republican party isn't going anywhere.  If you want it to change for the better then you need people that are moderates and willing to push the party back to the left from the INSIDE.

2767,RepresentativeZombie,https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-unmasked-as-top-donor-to-house-republican-pac,"Republicans, specifically in the last 20 years or so, have been incredibly brazen about solidifying their advantages. Democratic legislatures have gerrymandered within their own states, but there was never anything on the scale of 2010's Project Redmap. They never stole a supreme court seat, or refused to even hold hearings, in the way that Senate Republicans did with Merrick Garland and Neil Gorsuch. McConnell has generally twisted the rules every way he can to provide a Republican advantage, in a way that's mostly unprecedented. The closest the Democrats have come is when Harry Reid ended most filibusters for lower-court judicial nominations, but that was done in reaction to McConnell's partisan stonewalling. Likewise, McConnell has continued to expand the elimination of the filibuster.

Republicans have lost the popular vote in 6 out of the last 7 presidential elections, and yet won three presidential terms. Soon, a majority of the sitting Supreme Court Justices will likely have been seated by presidents who lost the popular vote. The supreme court, which was already right-wing on most issues, will veer further to the right. With Kennedy and Scalia, the court made a number of decisions that had the effect of strengthening the Republican's anti-Democratic advantage. The Citizen's United ruling, their decision weakinging the Voting Rights Act, and their recent decisions to weaken unions and allow extreme Gerrymandering to stand, all help Republicans to maintain control even as the country turns increasingly against them.

The Presidency, Supreme Court and Senate are all stacked in the favor of Republicans by virtue of our system of government, but that wasn't enough for them. With Project Redmap, they used state legislatures as a weapon to shut out Democrats nationwide.  With the Citizens United ruling, they created huge networks of dark money with the help of right-wing billionaires like The Koch Brothers and the Mercers. With the Voting Rights Act gutted, Republican-controlled states were free to disenfranchise minorities through voter ID laws and voter roll purges, measures that Republicans have admitted were put in place to give them an advantage. And now House Republicans and Trump administration officials have done their best to derail an investigation into the hacking that helped Trump make it into the White House. Polls now show that voters prefer Democratic congressional candidates to Republicans by 6-8%, but even a blue wave might not be enough to retake Congress. Republicans have weaponized the government to built a bulwark against the will of the voter, one that's unprecedented in scale.

So yes. the Republicans are different.",politics,t2_qkaot,8yvtcb,e2fzgzl,/r/politics/comments/8yvtcb/elon_musk_big_gop_donor/e2fzgzl/,/r/politics/comments/8yvtcb/elon_musk_big_gop_donor/

And rockets should be left up to NASA?? NASA attempted to make a reusable rocket in order to bring down cost to get to space, and they failed miserably. The shuttle was one of the most expensive designs in rocket history. Now NASA is building the SLS which, I shit you not, might end up being more expensive than even the shuttle. Meanwhile SpaceX invented truly reusable orbital class rockets, which has materially lowered the cost to get to space. This can only be a good thing.

Exactly, capitalism is exploitation.

>This idea that socialism is the answer is a joke.

When private corporations fail, and they often do, rather than being allowed to fail they are often turned into worker-owned cooperatives that on average perform better and last longer than the private enterprises they replaced. Ergo, not only does socialism work, it is routinely saving workers from the failures of capitalism even in capitalist ""paradises"" like the US.

>In your magical universe, if I generate 1000 dollars with my labor per hour and you generate 100, we should still be paid the same in the name of equality. 

This is a strawman, and a pathetic one at that. I've made it perfectly clear that workers should be entitled to every red cent they produce. A well-educated doctor who saves society thousands in what would otherwise be lost productivity should be compensated proportionally to that effort. He should obviously not not be paid the same as the low-skilled fellow who sweeps factory floors. If you think this is what socialism or equality is, you obviously don't know what socialism or equality is.

Absolute equality, which is what you're talking about, is only possible in a post-scarcity economy. Post-scarcity means money is useless because goods and services are so abundant everyone can get them for free. Ergo, there's no point in paying workers the same wage or any wage at all because wages have been rendered meaningless by the abundance of goods and services.

Socialism is not a post-scarcity economic system. 

Thus, under socialism the only meaningful equality is equality before the law, voting equality and equality in the ownership of the means of production. The last one is sometimes called ""economic democracy"" and is basically the concept of democracy applied to the workplace (under capitalism, the workplace is autocratic, a monarchy of sorts where the CEO is king).

>That's not equality, it's you exploiting me.

In other words, it's capitalism. Capitalism is the system where those who do not work or do very little work (CEOs, shareholders, boards of directors) profit excessively from those who actually work, especially those who work hard.

3030,mister_ghost,http://qz.com/844425/fake-news-is-the-newest-strategy-for-taking-down-elon-musk-tesla-tsla-and-solarcity/,">Many of the attacks on Musk begin with something factual: His businesses were built, legally, with the help of billions in government contracts and incentives for renewable energy and space transport. But they go on to accuse Musk of fraud and wasting taxpayer dollars; some compare him to a convicted felon. At least three conservative sites have run negative pieces about Musk—by a nonexistent writer named “Shepard Stewart”—that include “Elon Musk Continues to Blow Up Taxpayer Money With Falcon 9” and “Elon Musk: Faux Free Marketeer and National Disgrace.” Two later retracted the stories.

Okay, but where's the lie?

Saying that he's taken advantage of government subsidies is not a lie, per the piece's own admission. Saying the subsidies are a waste of money is not a lie, it's clearly a statement of opinion. Saying someone is ""like Bernie Madoff or Sanders"" is once again a statement of opinion, claiming that there's no return on the money they're given.

So that leaves us with ""accuses him of fraud"". The only instance I could find of that was

>Already grossly subsidized, Musk’s SolarCity has become an albatross of waste, fraud, and abuse of tax payer dollars

Goes on to describe SolarCity (run by Musk's cousins) failing to meet profit goals and posting losses. Tesla (not Musk) bought the company, meaning that Tesla shareholders absorbed part of SC's losses. The author then says that this smells like foul play - having your publicly traded company buy out your cousin's non-profitable company does raise some eyebrows, to be sure.

So saying that SC is ""an albatross of waste, fraud, and abuse of tax payer dollars"" is certainly tipping your editorial hand, but that doesn't make it ""fake news"". Anyone reading the piece would understand that the sentence referred to the paragraphs that followed it.

To be fair, the deleted articles are deleted and I can't say what was in them. But the headline said fake news, and the worst I see in here is ""they said he was wasting taxpayer money and called a business decision that they thought was sketchy fraud"". If these are the flagship fake news items, I'm not buying it.

Perhaps

**With Hillary Clinton out of the way, right-wing and ~~fake~~ rude news writers are going after Elon Musk instead**

There have always been misinformation campaigns for or against various things or issues. But with effectiveness of fake news sites I wonder if companies/individuals will take this further than Hilary. the article suggests that but I wonder how far it will go. Clearly Musk is competing with a lot of companies and disrupting a few very big industries. I'm sure there are people he's competing with that would like to see him go down in flames. 

I think the pizzgate story is also a good example of how to rile up a base. The trump section of America doesn't seem to trust any actual  credible news sources. Idk, kind of scary to think about.

3267,JoshuaZ1,http://qz.com/844425/fake-news-is-the-newest-strategy-for-taking-down-elon-musk-tesla-tsla-and-solarcity/,"Musk has stayed pretty apolitical, and has never expressed interest in running for office. There appear to be five possible major motivations for this action (listed here from most likely to least likely in my estimation):

First,  the people behind this are simply hateful and without a major target like Hillary must choose another.

Second, they hate Musk because much of his work (electric cars, solar cells, even wanting to use methane for rockets because methane is a potentially renewable resource) has been to deal with issues related to global warming. If the second is the motivator, then it says something really fascinating: that there are elements of the right which not only are convinced that global warming is some sort of evil hoax, but that they actively hate people who disagree with them and are trying to take steps to destroy someone who is trying to help. If that's the case, it is truly a frightening example of the depth that people can sink to, and the levels they'll go to not just ignore facts they don't like but to actively try to harm people who try to deal with those factual issues.

Third, there is a fair bit of evidence of Russian meddling in this election and that some of the anti-Hillary propaganda came from Russian sources to try to push the election to the candidate they favored. By the same token, Musk is potentially a real danger to Russian interests, since Russia is heavily oil dependent and also has an advantage when the US is dependent on Russia for manned space launches. If they have the now existing resources and hooks into the US public, then using it to harm Musk is a natural thing.

Fourth, the same tendencies that give rise to fascism frequently lead to anti-intellectualism, and in that context Musk is a natural target.

Fifth, this may be in part being pushed by those who see Tesla and Solar City as endangering their bottom line (e.g. oil and gas companies).

We could maybe get back the first 30% or so of production back to the levels we were at 10 or 15 years ago.  (Employment gains would be proportionally less due to better mechanization of production.)  But anything much beyond that would require Soviet-style ""fuck the market, this is a command economy, so we'll dig up coal here and bury it in a hole there"" type stuff.

We simply don't have enough coal burning power plants to consume much more than we dig out of the ground now.  There's also the issue that there are several different types of coal, and a given power plant can only operate on one type.  We have actively shut down a lot of coal power plants, and taken many others and ripped out the coal burning parts and replaced them to burn natural gas, for example.

There is some export/international market for coal.  Australia is currently the largest global exporter, but to gain market share we'd be competing with the likes of Indonesia and Russia where ""regulation"" and ""paying employees a living wage"" aren't big issues.  (Note how much closer those sources are to the big consumers - China and India...  Also, the infrastructure to offload millions of tons of coal from trains and onto boats isn't something you quadruple in 6 months.)

He's been for slowing down trade for a while, and he wanted to take up Perot's mantle and run for President on the Reform Party ticket back in 2000.

Of course, those hopes were dashed after Pat Buchanan and the Moral Majority folks decided to join and purposefully ran it into the ground, some say on behest of the GOP to kill the competition.

Now that we look to 2016, history appears to have a sense of humor, eh? Part of me still wonders if he will run a giant burn on the Bible Thumpers as part of his revenge.

In any case, the working white class men are demonstrably populist. Obama did much better with them, running on a platform of hope and change in 2008 in the primary and general election, compared with Hillary in both 2008 and 2016. It's hard to write off people supporting Trump to racism and xenophobia, when the turned out for an African-American with the middle name of ""Hussein""

3455,None,http://qz.com/844425/fake-news-is-the-newest-strategy-for-taking-down-elon-musk-tesla-tsla-and-solarcity/,"Its AI that is the main fuel for automation. Take every machine and make it smarter. Take every electronic device and make it do more. Once you develop the AI the cost to distribute it are neglicable.

Robotics are an important extension of AI and automation, but the driving force is basically data analysis and data collection. 

We have too much data these days and to unlock the potential of data at a much faster rate we will us AI even in academic progressions. AI will be able to read every academic paper for ever written on a subject in minutes or seconds and it will reliably find patterns that teams of humans would spend lifetimes not finding. 

AI or more accurately machine learning lets a robotic hand able to grasp things by learning. Years ago we would have to try to program ever possible object into the machine, which is fairly impossible. Now the machine can work on a set of rules to achieve a set of goals and remember exactly how it 'solved' each program.

Right now I read we will lose 1 million jobs per year to automation and I suspect as AI gets flushed out that per year loss number will rise. Large chunks of industry will get targeted and come under enormous pressure as workers effectively know automation is in their industry and going to replace their job. 

Self driving cars are the ideal example. What seems like a novel consumer technology will rapidly expand to replace taxi drivers, truck drivers and eventually delivery drivers and that's a lot of millions of workers with just one major AI application. 

House cleaning, landscaping are prime targets. Factory works has always been a prime target for automation. Twinkie was brought back to life by automating away 93% of the workforce with modern machinery and software. 

Some industries will automate more than others, not all will lose 93% of their workforce, but I suspect most will effectively lose 90% of their workforce, but MOST only means 51% in my world. 

If I was a corporation looking at investing in automation, but scared of the costs and you gave me tax breaks. I would use those tax breaks to automate and then fire my unneeded workers, but of course I would not talk about it until everything was ready to go because we can't have workers revolting or anything. That wouldn't be fair to the stockholder. 

Tax breaks or even wage increases, none of that is going to offset automation loses and this is just the start. The lowest skilled workers will generally go first, but office workers are not safe either. Customers representative work, tech support and even some sales are not safe. 

On the other hand some sales jobs will be very safe because AI will not be able smooze and flatter anytime soon, if there is anybody left with money to buy things...

Professions which primarily require empathy and emotional connections may do better, sales, marketing and entertainment will probably not feel nearly as much heat from automation as manufacturing a service work. 

Trusted progressions like police, firefighters, healthcare in general, security in general will not get automated as much. Teaching will not get automated. Construction and other dangerous but fine work will not get automated very quickly because it's very situationally based and AI will take time and teaching to get to the point we can trust it to do those things. 

I imagine we will train robots to do jobs more so than program them. Once you have good learning software and basic movement, commands and general awareness of it's environment, you could just basically use the old monkey see monkey do strategy. This is a top reason to make humanoid robots, so they can use all our existing tools and so if they all fail we still have our existing tools.

Instead of making a self driving riding lawnmower, make a robot that can use a lawnmower. Instead of a self driving drump truck, make a robot that can drive said truck and mass the produce the hell out of it.

That's the smart and modular model on how to do it I think. Every home gets a robot and that one robot can effectively automate everything because it's humanoid shaped and sized. Shovels, axes, power tools, you don't build that into the robot, you just make a robot that can use them. It's cheaper that way too. Industrial robots may be a different story. It may be worth the extra money and propriety to design them specific to their purpose.

Fossil fuel doesn't matter much because solar is at or below the cost of coal per kilowatt. Oil has to stay around until lithium can catch up, we should stop attacking oil and just push lithium and let the market do the job. It's faster, smarter and creates less backlash.

Attacking fossil fuel tends to polarize people. Pushing for awesome batteries does not. 

We have to consider the cost of victories, not just winning. Sometimes going head on at a problem under the premise you are doing the right thing winds up having a less ideal effect than ignoring the issue and approaching it from a differeng angle.

It's kind of like hunting. You don't just run down your prey because that's what you want and it's the shortest path to what you want. You gotta zig zag, cover your scent, think about the variables like wind and noise, color contrasts. You don't just run right at the problem and expect that to be the easy way.

You have to trick the 'problem' into coming to your or solving itself or find a way to approach it from an angle that does not alert it to your intentions. 

This is all because at the end of the day human behavior will always be the biggest obstacle to anything, so every solution should take into account how people will react 1,5, and 10 years down the road.

Too often we don't consider backlash and the new impact is to slow progress. You wind up with a big victory and then 50 years of paybacks and that's often a net loss to approaching the problem with more tactful strategy that takes into account human behavior.

You catch more lies with honey and you get more done with cooperation, even if you have to zig zag to get there, your pace of travel and overall progress will make up for your extended path.

There's no easy solution to this because of Western ideals on freedom of the press. 

The way I'm looking at this is that there is an ""information economy"" made up of various actors producing and selling information, and just like real markets, you're going to have unscrupulous businesses selling garbage, e.g., if I didn't need a business license or have government agencies watching over me, I could start selling ""protein bars"" from my garage made up of apple cores and old newspaper.

Regulation was the key there, but any attempt to regulate information itself is going to be met with resistance due to our Western ideals. How is this done without censorship?

You dont combat it alone

1) America puts a cap on campaign spending - NOW. (this is a better target than attempting to fix media. And as does America, hopefully more parts of the world follow)

2) Government paid neutral/arms length news agencies like the BBC, just to force people like fox and others to have to fight to justify their bias

Honestly though - theres no way the media can fight it, and the american scenario just makes it worse

Media houses have been on terminal decline ever since the internet ""DEMOCRATIZED INFORMATION GATHERING!"", which we now realize was the inadvertent paupering of editors who could exercise oversight. 

Yes - not all editors were excellent, and usually the removal of a legacy service with a new service is an efficiency improvement.

*BUT*

Only a small fraction of human beings actually choose to find information that goes contrary to biases *they know they have*. (forget searching for counter information on biases they dont know they have).

In the old market, an editorial board could in theory act as that barrier or provider of perspective. And at least it was manned by people who tended to take their role seriously and had cultural/professional heroes who gave them a standard to follow.

It didn't make everyone happy - but thats the point. As people in T_D are happy to remind others when things are in their favor ""you are sad because the facts don't make you happy""


Unfortunately in the market scenario, the market is incentivized to give people what they *really* want. i.e.: emotions.

Add to this mess the historical consolidation trend in the industry (meaning eventually a business house ends up owning a news paper)

And then consider that print media has been decimated, and that even news sites are in trouble because of ad blockers - and you realize that we've happily walked into a mess which we may never get out of.

The alternatives which we have to the fourth estate don't cut it. Worse - technology allows people to completely cut out the fact checking aspect of society and go straight to programming webpages to trigger emotions and thus action.

We need to break the skinner box.

This is a reason why we're so dependent on HB1. Granted it's a trickle right now but it could soon be a flood.

Anecdotal evidence: My partner has been looking abroad for graduate school for some time now. He is already saddled with debt (student loan and medical), so he refuses to add to it. If we went abroad, we'd likely not come back. It would depend on the market. Academic markets are pretty bad everywhere, but it's horrific in the US due to the lack of social services. And now we have an education privatization zealot appointed to the DOE.

Personally, I am watching the situation with the EPA closely. If it's gutted, I will likely have to leave the country if I want to keep working in my field. It's true that I could just try to weather the storm until regulation is restored, but unfortunately I'm reaching the time of my life where I have to think about what I really want over the next 10 years. It's about that time I think about starting a family and the next career step, etc. I'm in my 30s, and while I could maybe afford to wait until my late 40s, that's asking a lot. A potential 8 years of Republican deregulation combined with their disastrous social policies would obliterate my life plans.

The idea that liberals are ""smart"" and conservatives are ""stupid"" is what's known as the Dunning-Kruger effect.  The average laymen (of either side) doesn't know enough about history or politics to have an informed position on the matter (or a certainty of confidence thereof).

tl;dr; uneducated liberals are so uneducated that they're not aware of what they don't know so they assume they know all there is to know because a 30 second clip from a funny-man show told them so.

Don't get me wrong I like John Oliver et al. but they're not unbiased, telling the truth, or really that helpful.

For instance, in the last Canadian Election John Oliver did a stunt where he threw $5000 in the air because that's the fine for a foreigner interfering in our elections.   He tried to make it sound like Harper (the former Conservative) enacted that law.  Except it wasn't.  Paul Martin (a Liberal) enacted the law 3 years before Harper got his first minority.  John Oliver routinely glosses over facts and both sides of every story.

For instance, in his episode on bail/fines he had sob stories of drivers fined $30 who then snow balled into $100s in fines/fees/etc.  But he neglects to admit that the germ of their problems were unsafe driving practices, etc...

3538,sflicht,http://qz.com/844425/fake-news-is-the-newest-strategy-for-taking-down-elon-musk-tesla-tsla-and-solarcity/,"First of all, the QZ article is pretty lame -- I'd qualify it as fake news, and certainly fake journalism, since it's just rewriting a Bloomberg report. The headline suggests some sort of ""switch in focus"" from HRC to Elon, which is not justified by anything in the article or its sources. As a high profile technologist, Musk has had vocal supporters and vocal critics for years.

Second, I don't think any of examples they link to are actually examples of fake news. For example [this](http://dailysignal.com/2016/11/13/its-time-to-stop-spending-taxpayer-dollars-on-elon-musk-and-cronyism/) is just an opinion piece, expressing a common skepticism about Musk's business acumen and whether he would have succeeded in a more *laisse faire* economy. The argument that solar subsidies are a poor use of taxpayer dollars is a coherent one, and likewise for EV subsidies. Tesla and Solar City are among the most high-profile companies benefiting from these policies, so they're naturally a focal point for political debate about the merits of the policies.

With that let me turn to your putative explanations:

1. The people who criticize Musk aren't just ""hateful types"" seeking a new target after the election, because the chronology doesn't bear that out. Rather, I think they're mostly motivated by the politics of the particular issues they're interested in.

2. This is overblown. There is a world of difference between ""the solar and electric vehicle industries have reaped the benefits from large amounts of government subsidies"" (which is true) and ""global warming is an evil hoax"". Many people believe in the existence of AGW but don't think these sorts of subsidy policies necessarily pass a cost-benefit analysis. And the ""crony capitalism"" angle is a shrewd political strategy for them to attack the subsidies, because to some extent it crosses traditional partisan divides.

3. This is laughable. Musk is not a danger to Russia's interests in any meaningful way. There are not enough Teslas on the road, nor will there be for many years, to have an appreciable effect on Russia's oil exports. Besides, many other car companies are now producing EVs, so even if Musk was important in starting this trend, it's too late to reverse it by smearing Tesla specifically. Or is Russia also secretly funding anti-Chevy Volt fake news sites? As for the space industry, it's true that the use of RD-180s in Atlas V launch vehicles gives Russia a bit of soft power and a bit of money, so perhaps Russia has been harmed on the margins by the emergence of more competition in the US launch market. But again, if this were really enough to motivate a Russian state-sponsored propaganda response (which I highly doubt) wouldn't it also be targeted at other market participants like Arianespace?

4. Say what you will about libertarianism, as a movement, it's anything but anti-intellectual, and it's definitely not pro-fascist. The venues Bloomberg cites where the supposed ""fake news"" targeting Musk appeared include a lot of libertarian-themed sites.

5. Judging by the fancy cars I see in Hong Kong, Tesla's endangering the bottom lines of Mercedes and Lamborghini more than any oil and gas companies. Until it achieves profitability, Solar City is unlikely to endanger anyone's bottom line. And SpaceX is more harmful to ULA than to any Russian aerospace companies. So I guess we should conclude that Daimler AG and Boeing are the true devils funding this vile propaganda campaign?

Or maybe the whole thing is a ridiculous farce that no one should really get worked up about.

It's very apparent that the author of the referenced article from ""The Daily Signal"" doesn't like when the government subsidizes projects.  He assumes the ""green"" movement is a scam that Musk is taking advantage of, but has no information to back that up, other than lengthy R&D, and a lack of stellar profits. Cites that Musk has bought up a solar company that has gone under, and we are funding him in such endeavors, but has no proof about how that correlates with any sort of ""scam""

On top of having a fake author for three articles, two of which have been retracted, the whole thing is backed by a committee that is very much against Musk.  Does that not smell of an attempt to smear the man, instead of bring some sort of significant facts to light about him?

EDIT: There are 100,000 gallons of water in this lake.  Two years ago chickens drank 5,000 gallons from the lake. This past year they drank 8,000 gallons.  It's safe to say that chicken owners are abusing their right to have chickens drink water from the lake, all in an attempt to further profits in their chicken breeding businesses.  Why do we subsidize these breeders?  What if they fail?  <Insert some random facts about the value of chickens depreciating over the course of some odd years, and this is attempt by chicken owners to increase their profits.

If you teach people at a young age to be skeptical (not paranoid or unreasonably untrusting, but skepticism in the way that scientists use it) it'll probably help weaken the power of fake news and propaganda in general, whether it's from the government or from the mainstream media or from cranks like Alex Jones. I honestly think that guys like Jones get away with what they do because too many people don't have a lot of practice with critical thinking and skepticism; they seem to think that skepticism means disbelieving everything from 'official channels' and believing everything from grainy Youtube videos and tacky-looking sites that they are linked to from Facebook. 

They don't really realize or acknowledge that everyone can lie and that just because someone poses as an underground figure doesn't mean that they can't lie or even be honestly mistaken themselves.

The toughest part though for is disbelieving something that matches our worldview. This is when it's actually more important to be skeptical; most people are pretty good at poking holes in stories that they already disagree with but not as good at even looking for the holes/inconsistencies/missing sources in stories that we agree with or that match what we already believe. Even outside of the context of politics and fake news, you see that problem in business and government too. The prosecutor who believes that the defendant is guilty and ignores or downplays the alibi witness... and the jailhouse snitch who seems to know only what was in the newspaper about the case... and the inconsistencies in the eyewitness accounts... and the 3 lab tests that were inconclusive... 

Or the executive who has been working on a merger for months and ignores the warning signs from the independent audit or the fact that the target company's main product is now outmoded and their sales are dropping like a stone. 

It's so easy to get wrapped up in an idea and grasp at anything that even looks like it might confirm it; confirmation bias will screw you every time though.",politics,t2_joyxa,5f4u7z,dahllw7,/r/politics/comments/5f4u7z/with_hillary_clinton_out_of_the_way_rightwing_and/dahllw7/,/r/politics/comments/5f4u7z/with_hillary_clinton_out_of_the_way_rightwing_and/

> The people who criticize Musk aren't just ""hateful types"" seeking a new target after the election, because the chronology doesn't bear that out. 

Can you expand on this? Multiple pieces started showing up after the election. So what part of the chronology doesn't work?

> This is overblown. There is a world of difference between ""the solar and electric vehicle industries have reaped the benefits from large amounts of government subsidies"" (which is true) and ""global warming is an evil hoax"". 

Yes, but we have a President-elect who believes the second and it doesn't take much scratching to find others who agree with him.

> This is laughable. Musk is not a danger to Russia's interests in any meaningful way. 

In the short-term, certainly not. In the long-term though? He's done more than any other individual to get the general public interested in solar power and electric cars. And 

> Or is Russia also secretly funding anti-Chevy Volt fake news sites?

If such sites started showing up, I wouldn't be at all surprised to find out if that they were funded in such a way.

> Say what you will about libertarianism, as a movement, it's anything but anti-intellectual, and it's definitely not pro-fascist. The venues Bloomberg cites where the supposed ""fake news"" targeting Musk appeared include a lot of libertarian-themed sites.

I agree that libertarians are not in general in that category. Which of the sites did you think had a libertarian lean? Also note that there's a fair bit of interplay between the conventional right, and the libertarian-right. And even for libertarians there's a definite anti-intellectual strain among some of them (the ones who are AGW skeptics are a pretty good example of this).

> Judging by the fancy cars I see in Hong Kong, Tesla's endangering the bottom lines of Mercedes and Lamborghini more than any oil and gas companies. Until it achieves profitability, Solar City is unlikely to endanger anyone's bottom line. And SpaceX is more harmful to ULA than to any Russian aerospace companies. So I guess we should conclude that Daimler AG and Boeing are the true devils funding this vile propaganda campaign?

Right now, I expect that Daimler and Boeing will in general behave better than the oil companies, simply based on the history of what the companies have done. But I do agree that 5 and 4 are somewhat unlikely: please note that I did list the various possible explanations in descending order of likelihood. 

> Or maybe the whole thing is a ridiculous farce that no one should really get worked up about.

These are just a few of the top threads on Paypal in entrepreneur.

Part of it is people not understanding the limits of Paypal, but many business owners feel they're treated unfairly in disputes. And feel trapped into using them by customers who will only pay that way. I've never had a large amount of money withheld, but I've had to call customer service about some small issues. It was shitty enough that I know it would be a nightmare if I had a more serious problem.

I doubt this has much to do with the right-wing shenanigans being discussed though.

I think it no longer matters because e-commerce is such a huge part of our economy now, but 15 years ago it was definitely a huge issue.

The internet really removed a lot of steps when it came to buying something and probably has resulted in the slow gutting of many jobs.

Subverting competition, making it harder for them to lose money, subsidizing entire industries.

The financial industry is a perfect example. The collapse in '08 was caused by a ""credit bubble"", from banks handing out lines of credit to people who couldn't afford them. **This was perpetuated by government regulation and government institutions** who wanted to put a house and a mortgage within reach to all Americans, a ""noble cause"". They government regulated who these banks could and couldn't refuse and actually incentivized these financial institutions to make poor choices.

So what happens? People can't pay their shit, everyone's credit sucks, and instead of these massive companies failing like they would have in a free market, the government, THE SAME GOVERNMENT THAT ALLOWED AND INCENTIVIZED SUBPRIME MORTGAGES, paid off all of their bad decisions.

As a rule of thumb, such ideas will almost always fail.

Inherently trying to inculcate a set of ideas into young students is impossible for *many* Many reasons, eg

1) Variance in simple education outcomes: Not all students are even at the same education level in the same grade. This means only some % of students will actually get the message

2) Students have been targetted to learn MANY things, and work loads for kids are going up. This only ads something more to their workload - which they will eventually ignore

3) Educated, sceptical people are the ones currently spreading mis information, if not creating it. The issue is also information that leverages modern psych/communication techniques to find ways to slip past the critical assessment.

During this time, 5 freshmen from 5 different colleges watch the whole thing on their computers, and continue to watch the horrors unfold over the years.

Since they reject man made climate change they probably don't see the point in subsidizing green technologies that can't hold their own in the free market without subsidies. Thankfully I think Musk's companies and solar can hold their own without subsidies now. 

He should really consider leaving if the right's ideological arm starts to get the better of its business friendly side as it has been in this election, though.

Critical thinking is the foundation of a normal educational process. It's not or shouldn't be something ""extra""; how can you understand/learn science or literature if you can't think critically? Hell, how do you *teach* science at all without teaching skepticism? I'm not suggesting that a set of ideas be ""inculcated"", it's more about giving people tools so that they can protect themselves. I think honestly if people looked at everything the way we teach kids to look at literature or art that would be a huge step forward. ""What message is this story trying to communicate?"" ""Why do you think this writer chose this language, or this symbolism?"" ""What information could this narrative be missing?""

You need these skills in business. You need them in politics. You need them as a babysitter or a nanny. You need them as a doctor. You need them as a consumer dealing with commercials and Black Friday deals. You need them dealing with the courts. You need them as a young person traveling abroad or as a tourist visiting a new city. You need them in romantic relationships (although good luck realizing that at the time...!)

I didn't live in the states during the 94 LA earthquake, but apparently the government dropped off pallets of water, and neighborhoods in my area were just throwing big block BBQ's to cook all the food in the freezer, nobody even needed the water. If I was in another area (hurricane area for example) I'd prepare differently. It's fun to imagine how long I'd last in the apocalypse and mentally prepare for something like that, but the chances of it happening are so incredibly low, it's a waste of energy.

play this song https://youtu.be/u4_ZRsHwrpw?t=50s

6 years later, society is actually better off in many ways in regards to health and crime, however the world is still very Orwellian authoritarian. Those guilty of thought crimes become guinea pigs and sent to live in experimental Space Colony slums. 

Elon receives reports of large numbers of robots being destroyed and some areas are being liberated. Elon brands this as a terrorist and wants them dead or alive. Whatever is destroying these robots are ruthless and effective. Whomever lays eyes on it never live to talk about it. 

2 years earlier, 5 college students, unaware of each other, from 5 different colleges,(Stanford, UC Berkeley, MIT, Cal Tech, and Carnegie Mellon) worked with their engineering schools to develop mobile power armor suits. After 4 years of development, the students graduate and deploy. 

They fly to different parts of the world, starting in small cities, destroying smaller robots, finding weaknesses in their AI, and gaining exp. They run into each other at random times, at first bumping heads for getting in each others ways or thinking another works for Elon. But they realize they're all on the same side and team up. 

Along the way they confront Elon's most powerful and ruthless generals including Steve Balmer and Larry Ellison.

play this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jVcn6I452I

After defeating all the generals, they decide they have leveled up with enough exp and finally make it to Elon Musk's castle. 

At the very top floor they find Elon Musk in his R&D Lab in his most powerful suit. They have a fierce showdown, that eventually ends up in the sky. And then, in space. He is significantly more powerful than any of the suits but the 5 of them working together damage Elon enough to beat him. 

After Elon is defeated, he wakes up! Turns out Elon Musk was being controlled by a Sorcerer from the future using gravity waves.

They realize the sorcerer then takes control of Sergey Brin and Larry Page to continue his plans. 

Elon Musk joins the team. They realize if they beat Sergey and Larry, the sorcerer will just control another person. The team decide to use gravity waves to go to the future to confront this sorcerer once and for all. Elon enlists the help of his top scientist, Emmett Lathrop ""Doc"" Brown, to build a time machine. 

The future is post apocalyptic. 

Turns out the sorcerer is Steve Jobs! 

He didn't die, he just went to the future to see how it turned out! He saw the horrors starting from 2016 that eventually led to the destruction of the worlds societies. Jobs concluded that humanity is inherently self destructive, and the only way to save it is to rule it, and then he used his Apple technologies to hack Elon Musks mind. 

The heroes try to fight him but Steve is too powerful. They manage to escape. 

They figure out the only one who can defeat Steve Jobs is the person who defeated him before: Bill Gates. 

They travel back to the present and recruit Bill Gates to join the party. 

They then travel Back To The Future and Bill Gates tries to defeat him, but Steve Jobs has gotten too powerful from training in the hypersonic time chamber, and Bill Gates has become too weak from running a charity instead of a ruthless business. 'This isn't the 90s anymore Bill'. 

But Bill Gates is like Batman, he always thinks ahead. He reveals he brought Steve Woz, and he knows of all of Steve Jobs weaknesses. Steve Jobs tries to re-recruit him but Steve Woz is too smart this time. 

Under Steve Woz's guidance the team is winning but in a last ditch effort Steve Jobs starts to compress all time and space into a singularity. Then this music starts playing. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LbnMiO59cY

The 8 Heroes travel the void and eventually find each other. They find Steve Jobs again.

There's a reason why Steve Jobs did this. In the singularity, he was able to find the mind-controlled Sergey Brin and Larry Page and fuse with them. 

And from the forbidden merger of Google and Apple, out emerges a new horrific God like creature. 

This song starts playing

https://youtu.be/lpvUEsLMsRc?t=1m35s

Now our heroes aren't just battling for their present time or future, they're fighting to save all time and space! 

They put a valiant effort and they fought until they had nothing left. But it was enough to weaken the creature, which then splits into Steve, Sergey, and Larry. They walk over to Steve unconscious body, but he then wakes up!

He immediately severely damages one of the power suits. Steve is still able to fight though severely weakened! But at that point the team is so weak, they no longer can fight. It looks hopeless. 

Then out of the singularity, Steve Jobs biological dad appears! This song starts playing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIo7yajLQtY

He reflects on Job's adoptions and talks how even though humanity makes mistakes, it means well, and that it doesn't need saving from itself, but needs saving from a few individuals bent on controlling it, even for altruistic purposes. 

He then tells Steve Jobs to look into the future how the world would turn out under his rule. Steve does, and discovered it is suffering a similar apocalyptic fate, even under his rule. With tears in his eyes, Steve now realizes the truth. 

Steve has to release the singularity, but in order to do so he must sacrifice himself. Before he does so, he talks to Elon. Then he heads into the void, releasing all time and space from the singularity. He sends all of them to the time right before Elon Makes the announcement, but only Elon has memories of the events. The whole taking over the world never happened, and Gates, Woz, and the 5 students never end up being freedom fighters, and have no recollection of the events that transpired. Everything seems peaceful but from Steve's words Elon knows if things continue the way they are, the peace won't last. But that humanity doesn't need saving from itself, but needs saving from a few individuals bent on controlling it, even for altruistic purposes. 

Elon knows exactly what he needs to do.

Elon finds Thrillary (Trump fused with Hillary) and does this to it

https://youtu.be/q4CNM89W9k0?t=49s

Elon looks towards the sunrise. He knows that the future isn't secure, but he's very optimistic. 

Elon knows that he is the only one in the world who can recall how he saved the world. But it doesn't matter, he has to get to work and focus on his new mission, getting humanity to outer space when the earth inevitability becomes inhabitable. 

The End. . .Or is it. . .

But, Elon wasn't the only one who knew about the events that transpired in this passage. In an office on the other side of Silicon Valley, Mark Zuckerburg watches the whole thing on an Occulus Rift designed to view alternative realities. He feels that Steve Jobs had the right idea, but was too self delusional to properly control the world. He knew that it needs to be done through temptation, not force, and that's why Steve Job's society resulted in another dystopia. 

Mark starts laying out his plans. Not Elon, Woz, nor Gates will be able to stop him.

All other doubts aside, this whole critical thinking solution is only going to work if you assume that they have all the information required to come up with an informed judgement.

His big concern is that shows like X-Files make scientific claims that not everyone will have the critical thinking skills to separate the fact from fiction (aliens or not).

Now:  one problem is that TSLA has continually been misleading about a lot of its numbers.  That doesn't mean TSLA will fail, but it's always a reason to increase scrutiny.

Now, the specific reason I am doubtful is that the worshipful narrative is that Musk is a genius who sees this obvious opportunity while the rest of the car companies are idiots.

What I think is the case is that the current tech is just not there yet for a profitable electric car that sells to the mass market.

We will get there at some point,but when we do TSLA will face immediate competition for the majors who will have a large cost advantage.

Under this scenario, the battery factory is not a plus for TSLA but is actually a negative because it has them committed to a tech/process and the resultant overhead before the business model is really figured out.

Now ultimately we can talk about this until we are all blue in the face, and really we won't know until we find it if TSLA can really produce and sell the model 3 for less than 40k.

However, it's usually difficult to discuss this because ""Elon"" has a large group of fan boys who aren't interested in anything but promoting the company line.  That in and of itself is usually a warning sign.

A lot of these stories aren't as elaborate as Pizzagate or some of the other politically-themed hoaxes. Often it's something that someone wrote as a joke that got taken out of context (such as an Onion article, or an out of date urban legend that someone mistook for something recent. There isn't a complex web of lies to sift through or an elaborate smokescreen of fake evidence, just a single story that someone shares without thinking that develops a life of its own.

And even if someone doesn't do that much, if they get to the point where they feel mild suspicion when they see an article from a source they've never heard of claiming that China is selling plastic rice to Americans, that's actually pretty useful.

I think that this is pretty much the basis for TSLA – they're paving the road themselves to drive down costs by working out better designs, better batteries, better manufacturing, and in the process they're building a strong brand. Like it or not, owning a Tesla is a status symbol in a lot of circles. It may not be the wisest economical decision, but for people who value green tech, owning a Tesla is like putting solar panels on your roof or buying organic.

Not to mention, they're effectively first to market, which is usually a pretty sweet position to be in.

I'm not saying it'll work, but I think it will. As much as the major auto manufacturers have an advantage in terms of capital and infrastructure, Tesla is building a desirable brand.

The interviewer's usage of the word Nationalist may have been incorrect. I think most ""patriots"" also put American interest above international.

I agree that the government should avoid monopolies, but public goods need to be government funded or else they wouldn't be provided at all. Yes, military style contacts are often wasteful and prone to cronyism, but it's not like the government can stop spending on military altogether (although it can probably cut down a bit). How should the government buy military technologies without using a contract based system. Should the government give up on NASA as well? I guess an alternative is to have purely government funded research for NASA, which is likely to be even more expensive.

>  but public goods need to be government funded or else they wouldn't be provided at all.

Have you ever heard of government corporations?  They do not need to contract private businesses at all.  That's interfering in our market and decreasing competition. 

>  but it's not like the government can stop spending on military altogether

The fix is really easy and if I remember Obama said he would do it.  No more no-bid contracts.  

>  Should the government give up on NASA as well?

Considering the importance of NASA when it was installed and the relative unimportance of it now maybe.  

>  I mean if the US government offers clean energy incentives, he should take them.

Why?  Do you realize that subsidizing clean energy incentives either 

1.) Hurts competing businesses within the industry causing slower growth. 

2.) Hurts our economy causing slower growth.  

It is not the way to achieve clean energy it's the opposite.  Elon Musk has his money and will get his money no matter what he actually accomplishes.  That's the problem of crony capitalism.  

By the way you forfeited your right to criticize capitalism when you willingly embrace crony capitalism.  The faults of capitalism are because of crony capitalism not because of the free-market which worked for thousands of years (mercantilism before capitalism).

>  It's up to the government to decide how the money is spent, not Musk. 

Just like how it's up to the government to decide not the lobbyists which fund them.  He's part of the problem.  

>  If the government offers small business subsidies should they reject them?

That never happens and if it were it would depend on what is being subsidized or what's the attempt.

Government corporations are often inefficient at achieving the same results. I think there are pros and cons to each approach (I dislike some of the cons to privatizing government sectors).

I agree that no-bid contracts are in most cases bullshit.

In what way was NASA important when it was installed and is no longer?

I would argue that either subsidies or carbon tax is necessary because neither customers nor the producers ""price in"" the cost of pollution. Its an externality, in other words. The goal of the subsidies/taxes is to hurt the businesses that cause the externalities, effectively internalizing them. Yes, this will hurt the economy in the short term to benefit it in the long term.

Free market only works to an extent. It does not answer a lot of social and economic problems. I think you are too combative to enter a proper discussion with though, painting all your opponents as embracing crony capitalism. I am simply suggesting that the world isn't so simple and that embracing free market everything is going to cause many problems. 

Lobbyists are not problematic until they start bribing politicians. If you reduce lobbying to its core, its just people telling the government the position of their industry on an issue. Once lobbyists start having dinner with the politicians or exchanging favors though... I agree with you that the current state of lobbying is problematic.

I could give an f about a president saying well, I saved 10,000 peoples lives in our country, if we are bombing entire country sides with thousands of innocents dying in other countries. And then on top of that say you've only killed a couple, which most reports say is pretty false.

Truth be told, SpaceX relies on the government for contracts.  Yes, Musk's mission for SpaceX is to ultimately send humans on a mission to Mars.  But in the meantime, stuff like government contracts for SpaceX help pay the bill while SpaceX is still developing the technology and plan for a mission to Mars.

Musk is the polar opposite of Trump - Musk sees clean energy as the future.  Musk took a hit to his reputation by joining the advisory board so SpaceX wouldn't suffer for it (he also lost some Tesla sales because of it).  For Musk to leave the advisory board, it may lead to Trump cutting contracts with SpaceX and/or hampering SpaceX.  Musk is not doing this lightly and he is risking the future of SpaceX because he thinks Trump has gone too far.

In reality, Elon is working with the military industrial complex to score well-paying contracts firing missiles while wooing Reddit with dumb lip-service to way off ideas like AI running rampant and humans living cushy on mars.

But for us, this is exactly why it is a good thing Musk got in:

All the nations of the world send their best runner to a marathon. In order to combat climate change, the runners pledge to cut their breathing since c02 is a product of energy production.

Some countries are new and inexperienced, and pledge to try to cut their breathing.

Some countries are dishonest, and wont cut their breathing at all.

The USA pledges to cut its breathing by 25+% and will honor it.

Europe also pledges to cut its breathing by 25+% and will honor it.

China, who breathes the most, smirks and says I too will cut my breathing the best I can.

The Paris agreement while heading in the ""right"" direction, is still a very crappy treaty.  
  
Elon's opinion of it should be taken with a dump truck of salt since his business ventures are set to benefit greatly if the US is under a potential Paris Agreement.  
  
I like Elon, I like when people take care of Earth, but his opinion of this is super bias and the Paris Agreement isn't really going to fix the real problems we're facing.

Is that likely? Apparently not, given his behavior to date and the sort of staffers he has surrounded himself with.
