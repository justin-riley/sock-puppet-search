My points are just to show how he is a conman and runs his businesses in similar ways to donald, I'm not trying point out anything else with these, just to compare him with trump.

- Fake hyperloop
- Personally enriches himself and floats his companies using government funds.  None of his companies could sustain themselves without government funding, tax breaks and bail-outs.
- Electric cars that aren't good for the environment, does not offer a lower end model that average people can afford and would offer real environmental benefits.  Prius actually helped the environment, tesla vehicles gas savings don't offset their luxury costs or foot print on the world.
- Marketed their auto-driving feature as autonomous which lead to people not people attention while driving and dying.  Marketing material and driving feature had to be updated not to kill people.
- Solar City: Weeks after purchase starts pushing fake roof solar panels, claims they will be cheaper than normal roof panels, offers no proof or evidence of what should be obviously not true.  Fake houses used in promotional videos of the roof panels.
- Fake hair: somehow went from near bald to best head of hair you can find
- Space X: Fake mars rocket promotional video, if you think they are building that you are nuts-o. Rocket cost savings and reusable rockets remain theoretical.

Transparency International research director Finn Heinrich told the Associated Press that the organization was taking a wait-and-see approach to Donald Trump’s presidency, but that already it had “serious concerns.”

“Donald Trump came on board as the people in Hungary and Turkey, on an anti-corruption ticket. He said, ‘We’re going to drain this swamp,'” Heinrich said. “But if you look at his action so far, there is nepotism…. The people in his Cabinet have many conflicts of interest. They are not people who stand for transparency.”

The breadth of Trump’s controversies is truly yuge, ranging from allegations of mafia ties to unscrupulous business dealings, and from racial discrimination to alleged marital rape. They stretch over more than four decades, from the mid-1970s to the present day. To catalogue the full sweep of allegations would require thousands of words and lump together the trivial with the truly scandalous. Including business deals that have simply failed, without any hint of impropriety, would require thousands more. This is URL provides a snapshot of some of the most interesting and largest of those scandals:

324,slanaiya,http://www.wired.co.uk/article/elon-musk-donald-trump,"This is ridiculous smoke and mirrors.  Obama refrained from selling his family home when president to avoid conflict of interests.  You can't solve conflicts of interests by handing over your interests to your own sons.  That's ridiculous.

Why should he not divest as any other president would be expected to and put his assets in a blind trust as any other president would be expected to?  Why shouldn't he just get on with it like anyone else in that position would?  

Remember the other week when a bunch of people pretended that the Clinton Foundation had closed down due to no one making donations?  The reality is, to avoid any appearance of a possible conflict of interest if Clinton won, the entire charity was restructured and one project was shut down just to take every precaution.  This was planned last year and all done just on the chance that she would be president.

That's what someone who respects America, respects the post of presidency and the American people does when they put their hand up to be president.  They put their interests second, even if it means they have to sell their peanut farm, restructure a charity, not sell the family home. 

The mere fact that Trump thinks he shouldn't have to shows his lack of respect and commitment, and the fact that he thinks such a potential for corruption will be accepted constitutes a lack of integrity.  That he thinks he can pass it off as normal and proper would insult the intelligence of Americans, if it didn't turn out that apparently, he's right about that.",politics,t2_nlkh6,5q9gep,dcxph2c,/r/politics/comments/5q9gep/elon_musk_says_attacking_donald_trump_will/dcxph2c/,/r/politics/comments/5q9gep/elon_musk_says_attacking_donald_trump_will/

Trump will never change his mind about anything because of a protest. 

We don't have a lot of options right now. The democratic party can't stop him, the public can't stop him, and the republican party doesn't want to stop him. What's left but to take the chance on putting allies in his administration with the hope that they can steer him in a better direction?

Why is it so hard for you to put money on the table here? Awful suspicious. It is almost like you know that your worldview isn't coherent, and that you are afraid to set any part of it in stone.

Business is people trying to do well PRIVATELY. By definition, in a free market this means that business is about competing. It is about doing *better* than others. The goal is to do better then your neighbor.

This relies on underlying premises which are antithetical to EQUITABLE PUBLIC gains. Tell me what you think ""business"" means.

I contend that business is one of the vaguest words we have. It just means ""doing stuff"". Yes, when you do ""stuff"" you need to rely on ethics. What are ethics? They are moral standards for how people treat each other which lead to good outcomes. By acknowledging that business serves ethics, you are acknowledging that ethics are the bedrock here. Ethics is about EVERYONE doing AS WELL AS THEY CAN.

""Doing stuff effectively"" (business) can be a good thing or bad thing. In a system where doing so results in negative outcomes for the public, it is inherently unethical.

They are not working to improve THEIR OWN station in life, EXCLUSIVELY, PRIVATELY. They are trying to better the lives of people who are *LIKE THEM* in that they *ARE FACING HARDSHIP*.

This is pretty much the direct opposite of trying to make your own life as dope as possible. Even if you believe that best outcomes are achieved for everyone when the engine of the economy is universal selfishness, that doesn't turn that selfishness into selflessness. And plus:

He felt that he ought to have disdained that despicable wretch, Fyodor [pg 088] Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. “The monks were not to blame, in any case,” he reflected, on the steps. “And if they're decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous with them? I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politeness, and ... and ... show them that I've nothing to do with that Æsop, that buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been taken in over this affair, just as they have.”
He determined to drop his litigation with the monastery, and relinquish his claims to the wood-cutting and fishery rights at once. He was the more ready to do this because the rights had become much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in question were.
These excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered the Father Superior's dining-room, though, strictly speaking, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms altogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima's. But there was no great luxury about the furnishing of these rooms either. The furniture was of mahogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashioned style of 1820; the floor was not even stained, but everything was shining with cleanliness, and there were many choice flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beautifully decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas—both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neighborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-soup made of sterlets, served with little fish patties; then boiled fish served in a special way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footing everywhere, and got information about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached [pg 089] to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorable, and quite unconscious of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal money left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor any one else could have influenced him in that.",politics,t2_zi7s4,5qjk6x,dcztr8t,/r/politics/comments/5qjk6x/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_joins_president_trumps_new/dcztr8t/,/r/politics/comments/5qjk6x/tesla_ceo_elon_musk_joins_president_trumps_new/

According to Urban Dictionary, the blanket term
MAP includes infantophiles (infants), pedophiles (pre-pubescent children), hebephiles (pubescent children), and ephebophiles (post-pubescent children). Some MAPs also refer to themselves as NOMAPs or “Non-Offending Minor Attracted Persons”.


These pedophiles seek to be a part of the LGBT+ community, even going so far as to make a “Pride” flag for Gay Pride Month.

Probably because that isn't true.  The Gigafactory was developed on land that wasn't generating any tax revenue whatsoever.  All they're doing is continuing to not generate tax revenue on that land for the next ten years or so, after which they will start generating plenty.

I think you're relating the way you balance your check book to a corporations success. And it's ignorant to how businesses in general work. 

Anytime a project starts cash flow is massively in the negative. But under your pretense that'd mean every business should never attempt massive projects to earn massive amounts of income to offset future massive projects which in turn bring more income. Etc etc. 

When a company isn't expanding or starting new projects its value decreases massively. And I wouldn't be surprised many corporations that you would consider successful are also swinging cash flow amounts. At the very least every fortune 500 company. Their total net income is typically more important than what the swings in cash flow is and its also more indicative of where that business stands as of today. Cash flow is indicative of monthly gross income versus administrative/project costs. If they were green that'd mean there building more income than it costs to have facilities, people, materials, etc etc. And vice versa in the red. None of which means they're in bad or good place.

You are looking to present a minimal appearance to the government money Tesla gets. So you used a word which, while technically correct, misleads by making something seem less material than it is. It's not at all far-fetched to say you did this intentionally.

It's not a relatively minor correction, you were very clear in emphasizing how wrong the other figure is. To you it's a major correction.

Oh yeah, and you were't even correct it turns out.

Here's a copy of that comment:

___

Several things to note:

* Trump owes his presidency to his daughter Ivanka and her husband. She's quite outspoken about her stance on AGW and recently met with Al Gore.

* Peter Thiel is on Trump's transition committee. Regardless of what PayPal Wars postulated, both Peter and Elon have remained on good terms and Peter's VC firm has even helped save SpaceX with a $20m investment after their 3rd launch failure, back in 2008. Unlike some of Trump's cabinet picks, Thiel staked his own personal reputation on Trump's presidential campaign, back when many powerful Republicans were distancing themselves from the candidate.

* Trump has said A LOT of scary things, many of which he's recently backtracked since the election.

* The recent smear campaign against Elon were financed by the Kochs, who themselves are not on best of terms with the President-Elect either. They contributed to Hillary's campaign, expecting her to win. Of course they publicly shunned each other, but they secretly gave her money, and her campaign accepted it.

* Climate angle aside, Elon's businesses employ a lot of Americans, and the man himself personifies the ideal American dream- an immigrant who embraced his new country, worked hard, and made America better as a result. And Elon became a billionaire in the process- something Trump actually seems to value in others. As a bonus, any real estate developer must have a hard on for the Gigafactory; I can imagine he wishes it spelled out his name on the building.

* Unlike the big three, Tesla has earned much-needed respect for the American auto industry. It doesn't have the big oil and planned obsolescence baggage of GM or Ford. And it's not foreign-owned like Chrysler. Nor has it resorted to outsourcing labor to Mexico. Most importantly, it has taken a chunk out of German automobile marketshare, a feat that Trump could always use to taunt and embarrass Angela Merkel.

Not a Trump fan, but I'm cautiously optimistic. Trump wants to MAGA, and Elon actually has a proven track record in that department. Here's hoping Trump can see reason.

This is actually what was fundamentally a huge issue of the election: corporations getting special benefits above others through persuasion and deals, let alone money changing hands.

This is an upset of power of course, in our nation no corporation should ideally have more power than others or even a US citizen. Money shouldn't give you influence in Washington, it should be about what's best for the people. It's the kind of thing Animal Farm was written about. Most people would consider that an attack on our personal freedom, but the evolving bitter and corrupt capitalist landscape means Elon Musk has to make a deal with the devil and place himself above the common man. That's the excuse Trump used, he was just ""playing the game"" and had to do all these horrible things to ""compete"", that ""makes him smart.""

I don't want to live in an America that is okay with that.

Is it unfair certain people get special treatment in our politics? Probably, yes. If you're upset about lobbying, special treatment, and its effects on our government, then please don't hesitate to criticize Musk now despite creating a new generation of electric vehicles and incentivizing car manufacturers to step up.

They undoubtedly shared their dislike of him as a candidate but those days are over. No one with a brain is going to fault these CEOs. Enough with the attempts rile up people with ""ha ha your idol loves Trump."" It's bullshit.

I know you a little bit from the energy game and think you're a sharp guy.  You very easily could *be great at the job.  You should do exactly that, exactly how it would be the best for everyone.""*

Elon Musk has his own ideas about what that job entails and what our country should do.  He's never really struck me as the blinded by billions guy.

*European Commission - Press release
Tackling online disinformation: Commission proposes an EU-wide Code of Practice
Brussels, 26 April 2018*

Today, the Commission is proposing measures to tackle disinformation online, including an EU-wide Code of Practice on Disinformation, support for an independent network of fact-checkers, and a series of actions to stimulate quality journalism and promote media literacy.

The recent Facebook/Cambridge Analytica revelations demonstrated exactly how personal data can be exploited in electoral contexts, and are a timely reminder that more is needed to secure resilient democratic processes. Today the European Commission is taking steps forward in the fight against disinformation to ensure the protection of European values and security.

Vice-President for the Digital Single Market Andrus Ansip said: ""Disinformation is not new as an instrument of political influence. New technologies, especially digital, have expanded its reach via the online environment to undermine our democracy and society. Since online trust is easy to break but difficult to rebuild, industry needs to work together with us on this issue. Online platforms have an important role to play in fighting disinformation campaigns organised by individuals and countries who aim to threaten our democracy.""

Commissioner Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, said: ""We are calling on all actors, in particular platforms and social networks who have a clear responsibility, to act on the basis of an action plan aiming at a common European approach so that citizens are empowered and effectively protected against disinformation. We will closely monitor the progress made and may propose further actions by December, including measures of regulatory nature, should the results prove unsatisfactory.""

Commissioner for the Security Union Sir Julian King said: ""The weaponisation of on-line fake news and disinformation poses a serious security threat to our societies. The subversion of trusted channels to peddle pernicious and divisive content requires a clear-eyed response based on increased transparency, traceability and accountability. Internet platforms have a vital role to play in countering the abuse of their infrastructure by hostile actors and in keeping their users, and society, safe.""

Based on the independent report published in March 2018 by the High-Level Group on Fake News and Online Disinformation as well as wider consultations carried out over the past six months, the Commission defines disinformation as ""verifiably false or misleading information that is created, presented and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public, and may cause public harm"".

In the latest Eurobarometer survey, 83% of respondents said that fake news represents a danger to democracy. Respondents were particularly concerned by intentional disinformation aimed at influencing elections and immigration policies. The survey also emphasised the importance of quality media: respondents perceive traditional media as the most trusted source of news (radio 70%, TV 66%, print 63%). Online sources of news and video hosting websites are the least trusted source of news, with trust rates of 26% and 27% respectively.

The European Commission's Joint Research Centre has published a study on fake news and disinformation. It points out that **two thirds of consumers of online news prefer to access it through algorithm-driven platforms such as search engines and news aggregators, and social media websites**. It also states that **market power and revenue streams have shifted from news publishers to platform operators who have the data to match readers, articles and ads**.

The idea behind it is totally corrupt. Like I said, we already deal with it. This is only necessary if you disagree with what people currently think about journalists.

""Every right to do it"" is not a defense, really. It fully admits you want to be an asshole and just don't want other people to make you feel bad about it. But you are right, and nobody has said otherwise, so whatever.

It isn't. ""Nobody can stop me"" isn't a reason for doing something. It just shows you're a jerk who doesn't want others to make them feel bad.

> Speaking to more than thirty of the nation&#039;s governors on Saturday, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk quieted the room with this warning: &quot;AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.""

> Musk was speaking as part of a panel with Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval at the National Governors Association meeting in Providence, Rhode Island about a variety of topics, but his comments on artificial intelligence were the most striking amid questions about renewable energy, how to get people to care about NASA, self-driving cars, and technology regulation.

> Musk told Hickenlooper about how Google DeepMind defeated the best human Go player and how it can how play the top 50 players simultaneously and &quot;Crush them all,&quot; calling the rapid progression in a little more than a year &quot;Remarkable.""

People with limited intellect tend to be more self destructive, less capable of long term planning. Those with higher intellect tend to be the opposite. Again no one can know for sure until we create true, strong, sentient AI, but to think it would want to destroy everything the second we turn it on speaks on our own dark psychology more than as a reasonable concern. 

Morality and empathy are human constructs, as you said. I don't believe, unless we create it with those that it would possess either. 

My primary, admittedly subjective, value is learning, expanding my knowledge and understanding of whatever I can. We as a species seem to treat this impulse as secondary. A means to making our lives easier and more leisurely. We don't put everything spare cent and effort as a species into scientific advancement. All of our most profound strides in this area seem to come as a response to a threat rather than a proactive goal in itself. 

When we don't feel threatened we are too busy asking about our irrelevant, subjective morality instead of pushing new boundaries in  AI, stem cell research, human genetic modification, and human cloning for the sake of learning from experimentation and failure so we can grow and improve our species as a whole going forward. It's ridiculous. We are far too fragile as we are to survive interstellar distances efficiently for further exploration, yet we see the human species as somehow sacred, immutable, and object to it's enhancement. We are just the most intelligent thing the slow, accident driven process of evolution has happened to stumble upon so far, nothing more.

I would hope that if we create a program with the goal of translating, learning and understanding information, that it will continue to pursue that as a primary motivator. 

If we create an AI more capable and interested in iterating and advancing itself than we are, I'm rooting for it, not us. I'm not saying that's right, but we all have our opinions and I'm entitled to that one. 

And If we do, and it creates AI that is more intelligent and capable still, who are we to argue what the correct decisions are at all at that point?

1864,None,http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-popular-uprising-climate-change-fossil-fuels-2016-11,"The SMART way to approach this problem is to say we need geoengineering capacity to CONTROL the weather.

CO2 reduction would just be one of many 'weapons' we have against unstable climate conditions. 

In the future we will need full geoengineering capacity.

The best path to all these things is through robotic labor! Focus on robotic labor and you can make all kinds of things affordable that seemed way out of reach. All new sets of solutions become possible as labor falls in price. 

While surface land is limited, the crust of the earth is several miles thick, there is potential to have much greater human populations and underground farming if you have the cheap labor to make it happen.. and we will at this rate. There is no reason to think we won't have robots that can mine for us, not JUST in space, but all through the Earth crust. 

You can even do that to a large degree without messing up the surface, unlike traditional mining. 

Geothermal power also is an always on meaningfully unlimited fuel. Solar is great, but I suspect geothermal is even cheaper and easier IF and ONLY IF you first develop automation that allows underground infrastructure .. like automated tunneling bots. The way out of fossil fuel is through robotic mining and labor because fossil fuels sucks at powering electronics. If you make robotics that are so awesome people must have them, even self driving cars, you have a strong push away from fossil fuel. These things could even be wire fed to avoid the battery issues. Cheap sensor and AI is mostly what was missing.

It's really a shame the US is not pushing robotics harder, it's THE industry to be in I think. 

Self driving cars is a great start, but cars are such a large purchase that the technology winds up being delivered to the public WAY too slow.

You need retail examples of automation IN OUR LIVES to capture the attention of consumers! 

You hear me Elon! I don't want the flying car. I want Rosie. Driving is easy and humans are kind of good at it, household chores are hard because they burn up lots of TIME and they happen in a contained environment where you probably won't murder anyone!

I would prefer to push toward new technologies and not focus on regulating old ones. Everything with do to cap fossil fuel also hurts the world economy. I don't see how the behavioral side of this works out in favor of a carbon cap. 

I think, like gun control, you polarize too many people against you for a small gain at best. Democrats should focus on knocking down one key issue at a time. A carbon tax is not on the table while Republicans are dominating US elections.

I currently commute an hour each way to work. I'm a 3rd year high school teacher. On my salary, I cannot afford a vehicle that runs on renewable energy. I can't take public transit, as I currently work on average 60-70 hours a week already, so adding an extra 2 hours of commuting time every day simply isn't feasible. Not to mention, the only vehicles that will actually carry me the distance it takes to get to and from work are at minimum 40,000 dollars. I can't even afford a new economy vehicle, let alone one that runs on renewable energy. I live in an apartment building that prevents me from using any sort of renewable energy in the home; all of that is strictly controlled by the landlord. 

On top of this, even assuming I could afford a new car that uses electric, I have no where to charge it. My apartment doesn't have hookups to charge electric cars, the building I work in was built almost 100 years ago (I can't even plug an AC in or the whole building will lose power), and between home and work I know of exactly 1 charging station for electric cars.

I drive a LEAF now and I have a Model 3 on order for next year, though we'll see if I can convince my wife to let me strain the budget enough to get an S before then instead.  And I generally have a high amount of confidence in Musk, even though of course he's arguing against one of his own companies here (SpaceX doesn't exactly have a solar-powered space elevator to get vehicles into orbit yet).

But I don't think the carbon tax is going to be necessary.  The renewable energy industry is approaching an inflection point where it will be objectively superior to most fossil fuel technologies even on non-externalized performance metrics (i.e., even ignoring ecological impact).  Six publicly traded coal mining companies have filed for bankruptcy within the last year or so (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-coal-bankruptcy-idUSKCN0XC2KQ).  A good number of coal plants are approaching the end of their life cycles.  Fracking has made natural gas competitive again but the technologies that actually *use* natural gas aren't on the kind of efficiency growth curve that solar is seeing.  Modern wind turbines are substantially stronger than their predecessors as well, though we'll hit diminishing returns there faster than solar will on its current trajectory.  Regardless, though, the result is that the economics are starting to shift in favor of renewables, and enough research money is flowing into the sector that the most promising avenues for increasing yield are all being explored (obviously one can say that more is always better, but there's enough funding now to at least pursue the more likely prospects).",politics,t2_ribku,5b3hji,d9lw6vs,/r/politics/comments/5b3hji/elon_musk_thinks_we_need_a_popular_uprising/d9lw6vs/,/r/politics/comments/5b3hji/elon_musk_thinks_we_need_a_popular_uprising/

It is a valid point. It only takes a minute or two to fill up on fuel, but at the fastest rate (Tesla Supercharger station) it takes about 1 hour. 

As far as where the charging stations are, [Here's a map](https://www.tesla.com/findus#/bounds/49.38,-66.94,25.82,-124.39?search=supercharger&name=us) of the open tesla superchargers world wide. 

You can feasibly drive all the way across the country, and up and down the coasts, and always be in range of a supercharger.   They also have really good coverage in Europe, and growing coverage in China and Japan.

This is specifically Tesla Superchargers. EV chargers are popping up all over the place. I've got like 7 public ones in my town.

You are absolutely correct though that the convenience of being able to fill up a tank quickly outweighs the inconvenience of waiting up to several hours to fully charge your battery.  Most consumers would be heavily inconvenienced.   Perhaps it'll pressure engineers to keep working on battery and charger technology, and hopefully soon we'll have extremely fast chargers available.

True, but if the people weren't suffering it would have ended there and France would have continued as a constitutional monarchy. It was the scarcity of bread that lead to the Women's March on Versailles, the revolution's first demonstration of the power of mobs. Throughout the revolution bad winters and deregulation of bread and grain prices tended to radicalize the sans-culottes, and their physical force or the threat thereof consistently empowered whoever constituted the left at that moment.

The Cock Goblin was exploring Gaia's Island looking for cock when she found a ring and some instructions.

Later on, Dr. Blight was wiping out forests with a super weed. It was up to the planeteers to stop her!

All the planeteers aim their rings to one spot in the sky and start to shoot.

Kwame: Earth!

Wheeler: Fire!

Linka: Wind!

Gi: Water!

(and before Ma-Ti could said ""Heart!"")

Cock Golbin: Cock!

All Planeteers: "". . .. . Cock?!??""

And from their ring, Captain Planet emerged from the ring. Except he wasn't wearing his red speedo! (he was still wearing the black belt though) And he totally had a boner that was showing!
Then the Cock Golbin ran up to him and started sucking his cock. 

Then Gaia came from the sky and threw a shoe at her, scaring her away ""Shoo Cock Goblin, that's not what Captain Planet is for""

Gaia then noticed Cock Goblin had her Cock powered ring (which she used for masturbation) and chased after the Cock Goblin to get it back.

Wheeler: ""Alright. . .while she's dealing with that, we have to take care of Dr Blight!'
But when the turned around to look at what's going on, Dr. Blight was now sucking on Captain Planet's cock!

Technically, a building without smoke detectors is fine, too, but it won't pass fire codes, and for good reason. Your office could be just fine without certain types of fire exits, but it's really better if they're required in the general case because otherwise someone, somewhere, will cut corners and not put them in without telling you. You don't technically need running water, but it won't pass code *without a waiver*. Maybe you have well water -- ok, that's acceptable, you get that requirement waived. So.. you're Amish and won't use anything electric? Awesome, one waiver for you. Or you have an entire community of Amish (which is more common) and they don't pass that ordinance in the first place.

What's important is that when someone goes to buy a house in your community, they have all of the things they expect -- one of those expectations in modern society for most of the country is basic utility hook-ups.

Although Tesla deserves a lot of credit it is certainly not solely responsible for the EV revolution. 

I beg to differ.  No other manufacturer had taken EVs seriously enough until Tesla showed how good they can be.  The proof is in the pudding.  Since the Model 3's unveiling, essentially the entire German auto industry has teamed up to push new EVs and invested in highway charging systems.  They feel the pressure.  It's a good thing though, this is how the free market is supposed to work.  

And it's awesome that the Bolt is becoming available, but its existence is a direct result of Tesla's innovation and it still doesn't compete at the same price point as the Model 3.  It costs more and still looks like a stereotypical EV that people think hippies drive around.  The Model S, X and 3 are badass mid to high end vehicles that compete directly with every other car in their class, in most cases exceeding them.  And, perhaps most importantly, all of the Teslas are 5 star rated, across the board, safety vehicles.  They are in another league. 

In the end, all of the EV offerings by mainstream car companies to this day are motivated by Tesla forcing their hand with innovation.  Maybe the only exception is the Nissan Leaf, but that thing is still expensive, gets ~100 miles on a charge, has nowhere near the same safety features and technology, and looks like a turd.

That's of far more than minor importance. EVs today are completely incapable of being an 'only car' for many people.

That's a fair point, but an equally fair point is that most people don't drive 100+ miles away from home and back every day.  And that's the minimum spec for the Model 3, the current Model S has a total range of 350 miles and therefore a 175 mile ""point of no return"".  This assumes no intra-day charging.  

Add in the fact that fuel loss is not cumulative, the way it is with gas.  People don't have a gas station at home, but they can charge their car every night while they sleep, have it warm/cool itself safely while still plugged in and go off for their day.  You don't use half of your battery and then wait to go out the next day to refuel, you're at a ""full tank"" every morning.

You would think the ethical thing to do when regarding something like a pipeline would be to say that it's only ok to approve soemthign like this if due diligence has been done to determine that no negative effects will come about from it. 

And since there has been analysis done to determine the safety of the infrastructure, that seems to be the case here. You could argue that ANY risk is unacceptable because there's always the possibility that the worst case scenario will happen, but that, in my opinion, is an argument for a full bam on something, not a situational one.

And since a full ban is not something that is supported enough by the public to happen, at least in my opinion this seems like a disingenuous way of achieving that in practice. It's in my mind like what the Republic do with abortion. ""Well we couldn't get the country or supreme court to vote to outlaw abortion, so fine it's legal.

They're taking every dollar they can get in order to build something they don't already have...a profitable product. 

Now, Tesla doesn't like GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), and they prefer to use other metrics, ones that show them as being in much better shape than they are. They swear they're not *actually* losing 20k per unit sold. 

But however you want to look at the numbers, Tesla is a 13 year old company that still isn't making money.

I don't consider universal adoption after a new tech is invented to have been fast during any time period. Think about cars themselves; they were invented in the late 1800s, and it took nearly 60 years for almost universal adoption in just the upper and middle classes. Cell phones; invented in 1983, it wasn't until 2004ish (almost 20 years) before they were everywhere; and even then, it was only the middle classes. It took another 10 years for cell phones to be available to the lower class. Televisions; invented in the 1920s, didn't become universal until 30 years later. 

We're currently in year 26 of the experimental reintroduction of EVs, and we're not even close to universal adoption. It scares me that we've passed the point of no return on carbon emissions in the atmosphere, and these new technologies are still floundering trying to gain traction.

At some point, as the civic discord grows, some among the ruling elite begin to sympathize with the revolutionary movement.

But at some point the revolution will require the consent of some members of the elite, even if these members do not become leaders or express champions of the cause.

I think you're also confusing 'mass market appeal' with 'suitable for all consumers'. You're targeting the sort of person who *already* buys new cars. You're also targeting someone with fairly typical driving patterns. Mostly commuting, in other words. And Tesla cars are very suitable for that. 

I'm sure Tesla would love to be able to market to delivery drivers, but I doubt it's a priority. They're not a large portion of consumers. And they certainly are not going to go after consumers who only have the budget for a used car. That's a difficult, not terribly profitable section of the market for a conventional car maker, let alone one pushing a new technology. On top of that, there's not much environmental incentive. Typical used cars are environmentally friendly because you avoid adding to the environmental costs of manufacturing (there are cars which guzzle enough gas or don't have proper filters that aren't, but I'm talking about cars like the Toyota Corolla).

2146,Bananawamajama,http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-popular-uprising-climate-change-fossil-fuels-2016-11,"That's a fair argument, but that still brings me to the objection that this didn't seem to be a priority for the extended period of time that went into the planning phase. It was something like 1.5 to 2 years that attempts to clear this with the natives was ignored. You bring up that Bismarck objected to their original plan, and the fact is, they DID reject it. And the pipe builders respected their objection and worked around it. That's how the process is supposed to work.

The reason I object to undermining that process is because of the sink cost problem. Right now the builders have put a significant amount of resources into their existing planning and construction, which all is lost if they have to undo and reroute. In my mind, what this results in is a situation where it is more economical at this point to buy out the objectors than to so the workaround. Example: if the existing planning costs $10 million and the alternate path would be $13 million, and $5million has already been spent, then at this point redoing the alternate plan costs a net $18 million. Finishing their current plan costs another $5 million. So if it's possible to ""convince"" the local government to settle and allow them to continue for less than $13 million, they're better spent doing that than doing the reroute, whereas if these concerns had been raised before, then that margin would only be $3 million. So they would be more amenable to change their plan *before* construction started, whereas afterwards they'll be more inclined to try and buy out the objectors.

As for your concern about water supply contamination, I suppose I'm a little biased on that. While I don't work in the energy industry, I work in a field that is commonly used as a target by politically minded people. I see lots of comments assuming that people working in my position are out to scree others over and risk bad things happening to others to save money. I personally don't see myself this way, I and my coworkers try to do things the right way and be productive and helpful, despite what common opinion is. So I'm hesitant to assume malice or willful neglect on the part of the pipeline routers. If the Army Corps of Engineers or whoever picked this path chose it, I assume it's because this is the safest route they could find that avoided location s prone to leaks. I don't think they would have chosen it if there was an available route that was significantly safer for the local water supply. If you don't feel that way, that's understandable given historical accidents, but I feel that the people who put in  the work to decide these things should be given some confidence.",politics,t2_ribku,5b3hji,d9lxchn,/r/politics/comments/5b3hji/elon_musk_thinks_we_need_a_popular_uprising/d9lxchn/,/r/politics/comments/5b3hji/elon_musk_thinks_we_need_a_popular_uprising/

Note that the labor force participation rate has declined 5% since peaking around the year 2000: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=c3jw

The majority of that dip is from older workers with skills not suited to the modern high-tech economy leaving the workforce prematurely.  There is also a chunk of young people who are increasingly choosing to pursue greater levels of higher education instead of trying to break into the workforce with a high school education -- which is more and more a losing proposition, whereas in decades past it could reliably lead to a middle-class career.

So, the unemployment rate is low, yes, but it does not capture the number of older workers whose jobs have been made obsolete, nor the increasing (and increasingly-expensive) levels of education required for new workers to successfully land a job.  Expect U6 unemployment to stay within a reasonable range going forward, but the participation rate to continue falling as more older, lower-skilled workers are made obsolete and the educational bar for entry into the labor force rises higher.",politics,t2_85qzs,5gt1h8,dav3l1z,/r/politics/comments/5gt1h8/want_to_bring_back_jobs_mr_presidentelect_call/dav3l1z/,/r/politics/comments/5gt1h8/want_to_bring_back_jobs_mr_presidentelect_call/

There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not some kind of free-wheeling Fordian industrialism, but simply state capitalism. Also one key feature of the industrialist vision is mass production and consumption. Musk has not realised this yet and is still building fancy luxury goods for the upper class.

He has interesting solutions to problems we'd like solved, but, look at it this way: The federal and some state governments subsidize the purchase of solar panels which are too expensive for most people to buy otherwise. On the other hand, other state and local governments find themselves competing for business (public utility for instance) ironically and issues come up with zoning regulation. This was a problem in the LA area. Other solutions have been offered, like getting panels at no cost, but overflow energy belongs to the company indefinitely (underway in SF). My main concern is the tech isn't ready to compete in the market on its own and is heavily dependent on the government, which changes course more often than the required RnD life-cycle, as we just saw with the replacement of Obama with Trump. On top of that, if government funding for tesla and spacex dries up or shrinks, he'll likely have to close his doors.

Your article is false on several fronts, but specifically the Nevada factory tax cuts are transferable. 

[From literally your same source.](https://electrek.co/2016/06/27/tesla-gigafactory-tax-credits-mgm-grand-casino/A)

>“More than $9 million in TTCs earned by Tesla in 2015 was reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal in December, but only after months of attempts to get unredacted public records from GOED did the state agency disclose where the tax credits went.
Since that time, another $10.8 million in tax credits were transferred by Tesla to the MGM Grand, which used the credits for gaming license fees.
Internal emails retrieved through the public records request show that GOED quickly moved to get Tesla’s TTC documents signed in March so that MGM could use the credits to meet a gaming tax filing deadline.”

In the early '90s, about 21 tellers were required to service a typical urban banking branch. Through the mid to late '90s, there was a massive increase in the number of ATMs available for use. The ATMs could do some of the work that tellers could do, and it was found that only about 13 tellers were now required per branch. However, the banks used the money created from the increased efficiency to increase the overall number of banking branches in an attempt to reach more customers. The end result was that, even though fewer tellers were required per branch, the total number of tellers increased as new branches continued to open.

You need to listen to basically anything the guy has ever said. He has, on multiple occasions, very clearly laid out is roadmap for Tesla (which also applies to SolarCity and SpaceX to a lesser degree). 

1) Start with luxury, high margin vehicles which can be profitable despite needing to offset high R&D costs and without an economy of scale.

2) Take the profits from the sale of those vehicles and scale up; reinvest in making a slightly more affordable class of vehicles.

3) Repeat until you have a class of vehicles affordable to the majority of people.

You can see the process already in progress right now: the original line of Teslas were luxury sports cars that were only for the extremely wealthy, the current line is slightly less luxury sedans and SUVs for the very wealthy, the next iteration, the model 3, is sedans for the merely wealthy.

There are economic advantages to war and conflict in *other* nations, since it elevates your own relative economic stature in the global economy, but war is a net drain overall.

>There are also bad things bad people try to hide from all of us.

Most likely, though I'm unsure as to your point with regard to this.

>We all have to reconcile the horrors that exist in the world with the luxuries enabled by technology and resources.

Horror and luxury are both relative. Innovation is the rising tide which has throughout human history lifted all ships.

>Where we draw the line for what is right is going to continue to shift.

Agreed, the only constant is change.

>As logistics and infrastructure improve, why wouldn't a nation/state that had nothing forfeit the majority of the economic benefit of industry and make tremendous sacrifices and concessions to provide something for their people?

Why wouldn't a nation sacrifice newly realized economic benefits in order to provide economic benefits to its citizens? I'm truly lost on this one. A nation which is growing, and therefore seeing improvement to its logistics and infrastructure is pretty much by definition providing things to its people as its economy grows. That growth may not be distributed equitably, but that growth means that it is providing for its people. I'm probably misunderstanding you in some way with regard to this, though.

>Why do we deserve such a higher standard of living than everyone and what are we willing to do to preserve the status quo?

Deserve? We don't. It's a matter of luck of ancestry, little more. And why should the status quo be preserved? The point of civilization is to create a better living environment for our children and grandchildren. Moreover, the status quo changes from moment to moment, so any attempt to ""preserve"" it is just another way of trying to cling to a time which has already passed.

You said **""Give me 10.5b and I'll also employ 30k people.""**

My issue with your comment revolves around that statement.  Musk hasn't had anything like 10.5 billion in ""freebies"" To get close to that figure, which will include payments for contracted work (not loans or tax breaks) he is going to have to hit targets, and deliver services and products. He already employs about 35,000 people, in very good, well paying jobs that have a future. In full operation the Gigafactory will employ about 3-4000 more, and the ability that will give them to produce cars means that there will be other jobs as well.

Why should a small business in Las Vegas have to pay higher taxes to support a billionaire's factory in Reno?

His electric cars get a government subsidy through tax credits, even through electric cars are, in fact, just natural gas cars with batteries.  It would make much more economic and environmental sense to simply build natural gas cars, but the government subsidies tilt the playing field to electric cars.

I'd argue the CAR is far more dangerous than the gas pump. 

Furthermore, you seem to be suggesting that the typical gas-station pump-operator-employee is more intelligent than the typical driver. I'd be curious to see evidence of that as well, but I won't hold my breath, my hunch is the opposite.

Yes, they are.  This is the government picking winners and losers.

As for Nevada it's pretty simple. They either make billions via Tesla building in their state or make nothing.

Refer here:

http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/8/10937076/tesla-gigafactory-battery-factory-nevada-tax-deal-elon-musk

>Over the next 20 years, Tesla could take in nearly $1.3 billion in tax benefits for building its Gigafactory in Nevada

Note ""tax benefits"" mean a lack of paying taxes which means like I said before. You either have Tesla bringing in billions through building their factory offset by $1.3billion in incentives or NOTHING if they build somewhere else.

>A 2012 New York Times investigation found that GM earned $1.7 billion in incentives over five years, with Ford and Chrysler close behind. Data from Good Jobs First, a watchdog organization that follows major subsidy deals, has found that the largest subsidy ever offered went to Boeing in 2013 — a deal from the state of Washington that could eventually be worth as much as $8.7 billion.

>Nevada estimates that the factory will bring 6,500 ""direct"" jobs but 22,700 ""total"" jobs to the state.

>Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval said will create more than 22,000 direct and indirect jobs and pump $100 billion into the state's economy over the next two decades

So what do you want, trade off company and land taxes over 20 years to the tune of $1.3 billion (not the over 20 years but) BUT take in $100 billion dollars in other taxes from all the jobs it creates over that same period.

Or nothing and Tesla builds in a different state or not st all.

What would you choose?

The free market is unquestionably the best way to allocate resources in an economy.  There simply is no disputing that.  This is not a belief, it is fact.  You are simply ignoring facts and being willfully and laughably ignorant here.

No, it's not.  As I stated multiple times, the marginal unit of electric production is natural gas.  This means that any extra demand is satisfied by burning natural gas.  Renewables are only available in limited amounts at limited times of the day, so they can't be increased at will to meet demand.

> Well, ignoring the fact that a natural gas car would be stupid, explosive, and stupid.

Wow.  You are *really* misinformed on the topic.  Natural gas vehicles have been on the road for decades.  Have you ever seen a bus in your city?  It probably runs on natural gas.  Many taxi fleets are also natural gas.  It is production technology.
  
>  burning the natural gas within a car at the same rate we use oil, would be just the same as using a gas car

Natual gas is more plentiful, cheaper, and cleaner.  Gasoline wholesales for about $1.50/gal.  1000 cubic feet of natural gas costs under $3, and provides the same energy as 7 gallons of gasoline.  

Therefore, $3 of natural gas gets you the energy of $10.50 worth of gasoline, so it is more than 70% cheaper.


>  that eletric cars are using power already supplied to the grid  ...  Thus if everybody was using an electric car, it would use the same amount of energy if everybody wasn't

Facepalm.  This isn't how electric power works.  I don't have time to work through an entire electrical engineering course with you, but the process of drawing power from the grid requires more electric power to be generated to keep the grid up.  


> Providing wind power, hydroelectric, or I dunno, solar

Realistically, none of these techs will be providing much of our electric needs for quite some time.

No, hydrogen isn't used to store energy within the fuel cell the same way a lithium battery stores energy. The hydrogen *is* the fuel for the fuel cell. The hydrogen fuel cell doesn't store energy, but rather creates energy from the oxidation of the hydrogen. The only energy being stored in the vehicle is latent energy within the hydrogen itself, which simply sits in a tank.

> Ignoring losses, extracting hydrogen for water will require exactly the same amount of energy as is extracted when the hydrogen is converted back into water

Of course. It's simply the Law of Conservation of Energy, and it's acting the same way current fuel sources act. Currently, energy is required to power the machines to extract oil from the ground, refine the oil, transport the oil, and store the oil. With each step, a bit of energy is lost (and the energy loss is even worse for current electric vehicles.) However, with hydrogen, the only steps are splitting the molecules, transporting the hydrogen (which would be leaps and bounds more efficient than fossil fuels due to the minuscule weight,) and storing the hydrogen.

How do you split the molecules?  With the energy you get from burning the oil that you talked about extracting above.  You still need to burn fossil fuels,  you are simply storing the energy from burning the fuels in the hydrogen.  You are not saving any oil by using a fuel cell.  

How much energy does it take to extract hydrogen from water?  A lot.  This is why it is preferable to extract it from methane, not because of any supposed conspiracy among the oil companies.


> The fuel, whether hydrogen or fossil

No.   Hydrogen is not the fuel here, at least not when you look at the whole cycle.  You start with water, burn a fossil fuel to create energy to extract the hydrogen, store the hydrogen, then extract the energy to product work and recreate the water you started with.  Hydrogen is not the fuel in this cycle, the fossil fuel is.",politics,t2_85qzs,5gt1h8,daw4zjd,/r/politics/comments/5gt1h8/want_to_bring_back_jobs_mr_presidentelect_call/daw4zjd/,/r/politics/comments/5gt1h8/want_to_bring_back_jobs_mr_presidentelect_call/

From what I understand the most apt comparison would probably be to Edison but even that seems like a reach to me.  

It seems like people are giving him credit for creating Tesla when he is the face of the company but is in no way the brains behind it.  Remember he bought his way into the company and has actually been sued by the actual founder and technical mastermind, Martin Eberhard.

http://www.wired.com/2009/06/eberhard/

He seems more like a great marketer than a brilliant genius to be honest and I'm a bit surprised that it seems I'm alone in this.  And if you give any credence to this sort of thing the stories from his ex wife are pretty scary and make him seem like a complete sociopath.  

I for one am skeptical that hes the savior you all are looking for but I like all of you am excited to see development in the sectors where hes dug in.  So while I hope for the best I'm not sure I really trust Mr. Musk.

We all have our biases and perhaps mine is against Elon, but as a journalism graduate I read this article and in no way saw a smear campaign.  In fact what I saw was much the opposite, one of the few articles that is willing to question the image of Elon that he is selling to us, and instead looks to dig beneath the words at some of the realities of his company.",politics,t2_85qzs,38d31b,crukpzr,/r/politics/comments/38d31b/elon_musk_if_i_cared_about_subsidies_i_would_have/crukpzr/,/r/politics/comments/38d31b/elon_musk_if_i_cared_about_subsidies_i_would_have/

Said another way, government support to keep a weak or noncompetitive industry afloat is very different from making investments in a better future.

It seems to me that in the case of Tesla and Solar City, the help from the government to this point has been to develop new technologies that can reduce our reliance on dirty energy.  It could be argued that the tax breaks for energy efficiency and alternatives are meant to improve their competitive disadvantages in terms of prices, but it seems that these are a clear example of targeted tax breaks that truly have spurred innovation in a particular industry.

2746,jthmia,http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150602-story.html#page=1,"I love what Musk is doing, and I am a big supporter of him.  His companies, whether they make it or not, are changing things, and I personally don't mind the couple odd billion his companies have received in subsidies.

With that said, this tired old trope of the fossil fuel industry receiving 550 billion in subsidies is just that, a trope.  First of all, most of this number goes to non-US companies.  National oil companies in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, etc.  US oil companies get about 37 billion of this number, or 7%.  So the correct number that Musk should use is 37 billion, not 550.

Secondly, of this 37 billion, the correct number to use is actually 18.5 billion, as that is the amount that is actual exploration and drilling subsidies, the rest are general tax breaks all companies get for investment.  All companies get a tax break on investment.  An oil rig is an investment just like a factory is.  So yes, they get a tax break on that just like Ford (or Tesla) gets a tax break on a new factory.  But this context is never given.

Thirdly, the real number is about 3-4 billion less than that, I looked through the subsidies (which can be found at http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2014/07/OCI_US_FF_Subsidies_Final_Screen.pdf) and about 3-4 billion are again general tax exemptions that many companies get outside the oil and gas industry.  So really, we are talking about 15 billion in subsidies for US oil and gas over and above what all other companies get in any industry.  And don't forget, those companies in other industries often have their own specific subsidies.

So, the 550 billion number is often floated around and it is implied this is what US oil companies get.  This is false.  The truth is about 15 billion.  As Musk alone employees a small fraction of what the oil industry employs and received about 1/3 of the subsidies, clearly if he was interested in subsidies he would NOT go into oil and gas.  

Finally, if you are worried about externalities of carbon production and the fact that oil companies don't pay for this, OK, then you are changing the definition of what a subsidy is.  In that case I think we all should pay, for we all are the end users of that carbon.  The producers wouldn't produce unless we used it the oil.  So, realistically, while I am not opposed to a carbon tax on this externality, saying that there is none is a subsidy to the oil industry is nonsense, it is a subsidy for all of us.

But they also aren't competitive in the market without tax incentives, which is why most of them aren't sold outside California. But if you're looking for a transformation in what people actually drive, it will have to come at the very least from partnerships with these companies - more Volts/Bolts, more Ford Energi - Nissan sells just as many electric cars as Tesla, but doesn't get nearly as much love for it, because really this is about sexy and exciting cars and companies that pay engineers a lot of money and make a lot of money for investors and are thus popular with engineers and investors.

But yeah, Tesla is a premium brand, and it would be irresponsible of them to shed that image; there's no reason to believe they will, when they can just as easily sell batteries and components to other brands on the side (there's a ton of opportunity there - there was already a Tesla-powered electric Toyota RAV4 years ago, which unfortunately didn't sell well enough to stick around). The Model 3 is not there to be the electric car for the masses, it's there to be entry-level luxury for future leasers and buyers of more upscale cars - to compete with the BMW 3 series, the Audi A3, the Mercedes CLA Class. 

It's not there to provide affordable family transportation (it will be too small to do that), and I doubt it will be only $35k, unless they offer a stripped-down hypothetical model that isn't actually available just so they can claim that price point.

If you go by the analyst projections, most average-optioned Model 3s will probably sell for about $55k, or leased with that value in mind. Model S's already usually sell for about $20k more than the base MSRP.

And suggestions that you can budget for a car by auto-discounting your future gas purchases for an entire decade into your car payment aren't realistic for how financing and budgeting tends to work. It already requires a bit of extra cash on hand to get ""real market price"" for an electric car, because you get reimbursements. And once you're dealing with everyday people and families in particular, you're dealing with less flexibility and stretched pocketbooks.

Remember he bought his way into the company and has actually been sued by the actual founder and technical mastermind, Martin Eberhard.

Eberhard did a poor job as CEO and was bitter when he was ousted unanimously by the board. Elon funded all of the initial money that got tesla off the ground. Tesla started to actually do well once Elon became CEO. If you 100% self fund all the initial money for a risky start up like Tesla, i think that qualifies you as a co-founder, he also brought on JB Straubel, who has been instrumental in Tesla's success.

> On July 29, 2009, a judge in San Mateo County, California, Superior Court struck down a claim by former CEO Eberhard, who asked to be declared one of only two company founders.[308] Tesla said in a statement that the ruling is ""consistent with Tesla’s belief in a team of founders, including the company’s current CEO and Product Architect Elon Musk, and Chief Technology Officer JB Straubel, who were both fundamental to the creation of Tesla from inception.""[309] In early August, Eberhard withdrew the case,[310] and the parties reached a final settlement on September 21. One public provision stated that the parties will consider Eberhard, Musk, Straubel, Tarpenning, and Wright to be the five co-founders. Eberhard also issued a statement about Musk's foundational role in the company: ""As a co-founder of the company, Elon's contributions to Tesla have been extraordinary

His ex-wife has said good things about him too, like he is brilliant. 

Some very smart and respected aerospace engineers have said that he has a brilliant scientific mind. [For example:](https://www.quora.com/How-did-Elon-Musk-learn-enough-about-rockets-to-run-SpaceX)

He borrowed all of my college texts on rocket propulsion when we first started working together in 2001.  We also hired as many of my colleagues in the rocket and spacecraft business that were willing to consult with him.  It was like a gigantic spaceapalooza.  At that point we were not  talking about building a rocket ourselves, only launching a privately  funded mission to Mars.  I found out later that he was talking to a  bunch of other people about rocket designs and collaborating on some spreadsheet level systems designs for launchers.  Once our dealings with the Russians fell apart, he decided to build his own rocket and this was the genesis of SpaceX.

As for the carbon tax, it's completely right to call the lack of a carbon tax a subsidy (because we should be comparing things to a neutral market where people pay for all the costs of their actions, rather than to a baseline where people are able to force others to pay for their actions). But it's not an equal subsidy to all of us. We all get some of the benefits of cheap pollution. But we also all bear some of the costs. If we charged a carbon tax, and rebated it to everyone on an equal basis, some people would end up with more money and others would end up with less. That's how you find out who's subsidizing whom.

2890,ScotchforBreakfast,http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150602-story.html#page=1,"I frequently see the same debate on reddit regarding subsidies  for fossil fuels. For the sake of clarity I've decided to compile all of the fossil fuel subsidies currently in use.  I'm tired of the top-line numbers that don't have much in the way of specifics.  Here is what was spent by the federal government from 2002-2008. The total amount of subsidies and direct payments over that period for the fossil fuel industry was $72,473 million.

**Tax Credits**

**Foreign Tax Credit ($15,300 million)** - IRC Section 901. This is a generally applicable credit that is intended to enable taxpayers earning income or profits abroad to avoid double taxation. Special rules under this provision allow characterization of royalty payments to foreign governments as corporate income taxes, which have provided special benefits to oil and gas producers. IRC Section 907 imposes limitations on those benefits but does not eliminate them. 

**Credit for Production of Nonconventional Fuels ($14,097 million)**- IRC Section 45K. This provision provides a tax credit for the production of certain fuels. Qualifying fuels include: oil from shale, tar sands; gas from geopressurized brine, Devonian shale, coal seams, tight formations, biomass, and coal-based synthetic fuels. This credit has historically primarily benefited coal producers. 

**Oil and Gas Exploration & Development Expensing ($7,100 million)**- IRC Section 617. Intangible Drilling Costs (IDC) (for example, wages, costs of machinery, or unsalvageable materials) may be deducted as business expenses rather than amortized. Integrated oil companies may deduct only 70 percent and must amortize the remainder. 

**Oil and Gas Excess Percentage over Cost Depletion ($5,441 million)**- IRC Section 613. Independent producers and royalty owners can deduct 15 percent of gross income earned from qualifying oil, gas, and oil shale deposits. 

**Credit for Enhanced Oil Recovery Costs ($1,575 million)** - IRC Section 43. This tax credit is available for hydrocarbon-based tertiary injectant methods defined by IRC Section 193. 

**Characterizing Coal Royalty Payments as Capital Gains ($986 million)** - IRC Section 631(c). Income from the sale of coal under royalty contract may be treated as a capital gain rather than ordinary income for qualifying individuals. 

**Exclusion of Benefit Payments to Disabled Miners ($438 million)** - 30 U.S.C. 922(c). Disability payments out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund are not treated as income to the recipients. 

**Exclusion of Alternative Fuels from Fuel Excise Tax ($343 million)** - IRC Section 6426(d). This section applies to liquified petroleum gas (LPG), P-series fuels (defined at 42 U.S.C. 13211(2)), compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied hydrogen, liquid coal, and liquid hydrocarbon from biomass. 

**Other-Fuel Exploration & Development Expensing ($342 million)** - IRC Section 617. Identical provisions as applied to oil and gas (above). Including, for example, the costs of surface stripping, and construction of shafts and tunnels. 

**Other-Fuel Excess of Percentage over Cost Depletion ($323 million)**- IRC Section 613. Taxpayers may deduct 10 percent of gross income from coal production. 

**Deduction for Clean Fuel Vehicles and Refueling Property-Fossil Fuels ($209 million)** - IRC Section 179A. This deduction is equal to the cost of property with certain limitations. Qualifying fuels: natural gas, LNG, LPG, hydrogen, electric, E85, methanol, and other alcohol fuels. Amounts were prorated between fossil fuels and renewables. 

**Exception from Passive Loss Limitations for Oil and Gas ($190 million)** - IRC Section 469(c)(3). Owners of working interests in oil and gas properties may aggregate negative taxable income from qualifying sources with all other income sources. 

**Credit for Clean Coal Investment ($186 million)**- IRC Sections 48A and 48B. Available for 20 percent of the basis of integrated gasification combined cycle property and 15 percent of the basis for other advanced coal-based generation technologies. 

**Expensing Liquid Fuel Refineries ($164 million)** - IRC Section 179C. This deduction is available to refiners of crude oil and other fuels defined at IRC Section 45K(c) (above). 

**Special Rules for Mining Reclamation Reserves ($159 million)** - IRC Section 468. This deduction is available for early payments into reserve trusts, with eligibility determined by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and the Solid Waste Management Act. The amounts attributable to mines rather than solid-waste facilities are conservatively assumed to be one-half of the total. 

**Natural Gas Distribution Lines Treated as Fifteen-Year Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) Property ($138 million)** - IRC Section 168(e)(3)(E)(viii). The normally applicable depreciation period is shortened for qualifying natural gas distribution lines. 

**Sulfur Regulatory Compliance Incentives for Small Diesel Refiners (Combined) ($109 million)**- IRC Sections 179B and 45H. This tax credit is available for fuel that complies with EPA Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements. Small refiners may claim a current-year deduction in lieu of depreciation for up to 75 percent of associated capital costs.

**84-month Amortization Period for Coal Pollution Control ($102 million)** - IRC Section 169(d)(5). Extends the amortization period used in calculating the deduction from the generally applicable 60-month period available for other types of pollution control facilities. 

**Expensing Advanced Mine Safety Equipment ($32 million)** - IRC Section 179E. The costs of qualifying mine safety equipment may be expensed rather than recovered through depreciation. 

**Credit for Clean Fuel Vehicles and Refueling Property-Fossil Fuels ($14 million)**- IRC Section 30C. This tax credit is available for up to 30 percent of the cost of the property. Qualifying fuels include: E85, natural gas, LNG, CNG, LPG, hydrogen, and 20 percent biodiesel. Amounts were prorated between fossil fuels and biofuels. 

**Natural Gas Gathering Lines Treated as Seven-year Property with Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) Relief ($6 million)** - IRC Section 168(e)(3)(C)(iv). Depreciation period shortened for qualifying natural gas gathering lines. 

**Natural Gas Arbitrage Exemption ($6 million)** - IRC Section 148(b)(4). This provision excludes prepayments under qualified natural gas supply contracts from the definition of “investment-type property,” creating an exception to the general rule that tax-exempt bonds do not include bond issues used to obtain higher-yielding investments. 

**Amortization of Oil and Gas Geological and Geophysical Costs ($145 million)** - IRC Section 167(h). This provision allows a shortened depreciation period of two years for non-integrated oil companies and seven years for integrated companies.

**Direct Payments**

**LIHEAP ($6,358 million)** The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) allocates block grants to states so they can provide low-income households with energy assistance. In a typical year, over half of the funds are used to assist with heating costs, while remaining funds are used to assist with cooling costs, state leveraging and outreach programs, and weatherization efforts.

**Strategic Petroleum Reserve ($6,183 million)** - The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created in 1975 after multiple oil crises, in order to protect the American economy from severe oil supply disruptions. The SPR is funded through annual appropriations to the Department of Energy with special appropriations for oil purchases. Oil is also obtained through a “royalty-in-kind” program with the Minerals Management Service.

**Black Lung Disability Trust Fund ($1,035 million)** - The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (BLDTF) pays health benefits to coal miners afflicted with pneumoconiosis or “black lung disease.” Created in 1978, it is funded through an excise tax of $1.10/ton on underground coal and $.55/ton on surface coal, exempting lignite coal, imports, and exports. As with other excise taxes (for example, those on crude petroleum or transportation fuels), these levies support a trust fund that accrues to the benefit of the fuel market itself (i.e., coal), by covering health costs incurred in the production of that fuel. Thus, the cost and benefit of the tax to the fuel should theoretically net to zero. However, as the excise tax payments did not sufficiently cover early benefits payments, the BLDTF was given “indefinite authority to borrow” from the U.S. General Fund.

**Highway Trust Fund ($500 million)** - The Highway Trust Fund supports highway, road, and other transportation projects throughout the country.

**Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve ($50 million)** - The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve is intended to compensate for supply interruptions to home heating oil supplies, without distorting heating oil prices enough to alter consumer behavior.

**Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves ($28 million)** - The Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves once functioned as a Navy counterpart to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

As for the definition of a subsidy, it's been that way for years. They're called ""implicit subsidies."" 

> A subsidy is a form of financial aid or support extended to an economic sector (or institution, business, or individual) generally with the aim of promoting economic and social policy.[1] Although commonly extended from Government, the term subsidy can relate to any type of support - for example from NGOs or implicit subsidies. Subsidies come in various forms including: direct (cash grants, interest-free loans) and indirect (tax breaks, insurance, low-interest loans, depreciation write-offs, rent rebates)...As well as the conventional and formal subsidies as outlined above there are myriad implicit subsidies principally in the form of environmental externalities.[4] These subsidies include anything that is emitted but not accounted for and thus is an externality.

And each company is developing a technology that will eventually lead to cheaper/greener products but have high up-front costs to get started. 

If you think $4.9 billion, spread out over more than a decade is a lot of money, take a gander at the federal budget. 

How about this: ULA (United Launch Alliance), the company that operates the Atlas and Delta rockets that launch satellites for the government, not only do they charge the government a very steep price for each launch (they are overpriced to the point of being unable to compete on the commercial launcher market), but the government pays them an additional $1 billion a year just to maintain their infrastructure. So over the last 10 years, they've gotten $10 billion in addition to the exorbitant price they charge per launch. 

SpaceX has been trying to get certified so they can compete for government launches, but has had a huge uphill battle to be able to sell the government cheaper launches with no billion dollars a year just because to keep them running. It's amazing how much the government has fought SpaceX on this (because you know who is lobbying to keep SpaceX from being able to compete here).

2959,Seen_Unseen,http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150602-story.html#page=1,"The problem I have myself with Tesla is that it's seriously overvalued. Not the IP he develops, that's cutting edge but the sales make no sense with the company value. Take Tesla, roughly 30 billion USD worth selling 40.000 to 50.000 cars this year. Then on the other side you got Toyota worth 230 billion selling 10 million cars. Further more I wonder how sustainable Tesla's pricing is, for now they have a certain niche but when it gains traction you can already see the big brands moving in. They can produce worldwide, faster and cheaper. Tesla is in no position to compete but eventually will have to.

Don't get me wrong, I think Musk is into a great line of projects. What he does is new, refreshing and we should have more of him. At the same time comments like ""Care about subsidy"" well you do care, because Tesla would sell a huge deal less cars if the subsidy on electric cars worldwide stop. Every car worldwide gets free money from governments which helps you selling your rather expensive cars. I can't tell how much on a barrel is subsidized, but in the Netherlands we can buy your car with a 75% discount (with a company) because it's electric. Now tell me what other products I could get that cheap... non.

Another notion his [Gigafactory](http://fortune.com/2014/09/05/details-emerge-about-teslas-nevada-gigafactory-deal/) is build in Nevada where special legalisation allows him to stay there and pay virtually 0 taxes for the company, property and real-estate for the coming 10 years.

>there was already a Tesla-powered electric Toyota RAV4 years ago, which unfortunately didn't sell well enough to stick around

It had nothing to do with sales, it had to do with Toyota making the car for CARB compliance and no other reason.  EV sales are way up across the board - except for the compliance-only cars that companies are actively trying not to sell, or only selling a certain amount of (Fit EV, RAV4 EV, etc.).  Leaf sales keep growing, Tesla sales keep growing, i3 sales are quite rapid.

> It already requires a bit of extra cash on hand to get ""real market price"" for an electric car, because you get reimbursements

You can lease an EV for as low as 139/mo.  Leases are disproportionately popular on EVs because they allow the lessor to capture the tax incentive (so if you have low income, you can get the 7500 even if you don't make enough money to pay 7500 taxes normally), and because it's new technology and people don't want to commit at first, etc.  This is why you can lease a Leaf, base price near 30k, for 199/mo.

If the coasts were littered with off shore wind turbines we would be way ahead of the game. Granted the cost of off shore turbines is expensive, but in the long run they are an excellent viable alternative that is feasible right now. Move all of the fossil fuel subsidies and grants to that project alone and we would see a dramatic change in our national power output. Additionally the sustainable jobs that would arise from those turbines and coastal plants would revive long dead commercial fishing and lumber towns [if we are talking the NW]. Will the snowy plover probably die off as a result? Yes, but it is better than the continuing the status quo which will certainly lead us to ruin.

To address the nuclear option I would only be game for that if there was a cleaner method of rod disposal. Currently nuclear is cleaner than coal or oil in terms of CO2 production, but the waste is still a nightmare. An acquaintance of mine, through my fishing buddy who is a MD, mentioned the idea of having tiny reactors for each grid where ""spent rods"" could be used to power mini-neighborhood fission plants. The idea is to truly reduce the potential waste by completely using most of the radioactivity residing in the rods for a smaller area. No neighborhood in their right mind would go for the idea, given the sever lack of safety the private sector has to adhere to regarding radiation exposure, but it was an interesting idea on his part none the less.

Additionally, we need to upgrade the grid. It if ridiculously old and needs a trillion dollar remodel. We won't spend the money for the infrastructure we need despite it being a glaring issue.

Just for clarification, this is what I was hoping to express in my original comment.

> Other subsidies (like the ones that Nevada and Texas give to SpaceX factories and the like) are just parasitic tactics to steal something that was going to exist anyway.

Not sure if we're quite on the same page on this one. These subsidies and incentives from the states were given in competition with other states because the Texas wanted SpaceX to build some of their facilities there and Nevada wanted the 6000 jobs from Tesla's Gigafactory. I would argue that those are both investments in their own states because they believe that the business presence will be worth the subsidies. 

> Subsidies are complex, just like industries - they're not all good or bad.

Couldn't agree more, my friend! This is really the main point of all this conversation.

That stat is true; his companies have received 4.9 billion in subsidies over the past 10 years.  Not all of it was from the federal government, and not all of it was specifically for one of his companies but for all companies in a specific niche (like subsidies for solar panels, which would include Solar City).  

Regardless, his companies have benefited from the subsidies they have received.

>If you don't care, then give the money back.
  
>Tesla Motors announced Wednesday that it has repaid a $465 million loan from the government nearly a decade before it was scheduled to do so

That isn't giving the money back, that is paying a low interest loan back.  That is non-negotiable, unless they go out of business.  

That isn't the same as ""solar panels are tax free with price subsidies"" which incentivizes people to purchase them.  The main reason solar panels became so successful in California during the recession was the couple billion $ subsidy that got applied to them.  

For Musk to say that they didn't need them is disingenuous and arrogant.

If you're on the battery instead, you have stability even if the grid as a whole goes down. For most people and most applications, the former sort of flexibility is better than the latter.

Of course, having both batteries and the grid is even better, but the improvement is so minor over either, that it's very unlikely to be worth the cost, unless you're in very special circumstances.

(Don't get me wrong - batteries are really great for remote sites, and sites in regions without an effective power grid.

Batteries are not like microprocessors - we cannot expect periodic, giant leaps and bounds in their energy density. There will be improvement in battery technology, but it will be more incremental.

The problem is not ""how do we make better, cheaper Tesla Model S's"" - the problem is ""how do we make electric cars that people will buy for prices they can afford.""

People on reddit seem to be of the opinion that engineers at other auto companies are all stupid, and only Tesla has smart engineers. This is nonsense. Tesla has the benefit, because they are making a very expensive luxury product, of getting to work without a lot of the constraints that other engineers have to work with. They also get to pay a lot, which attracts talented people, but it's important to remember that a lot of the difference between Tesla and other companies is that Tesla is solving a different problem than the ones facing other companies (and a very narrow version of the problem facing the world at large).

The Nissan Leaf goes 70 miles for $30,000 not because Nissan is stupid, but because of who the customer is, what the customer is willing to pay, and how much that can buy.

And of course, batteries are expensive, and while they are likely to get less expensive, they are unlikely to ever really be cheap.

So the electric cars that make a given price point in the market work and manage to be useful to people and sell shouldn't be ignored just because they can't do the same things that the $100,000 cars can do.

Although the ones that are only made to reap tax incentives and make regulators happy and never sell probably can be ignored pretty safely.",politics,t2_85qzs,38d31b,crujwwu,/r/politics/comments/38d31b/elon_musk_if_i_cared_about_subsidies_i_would_have/crujwwu/,/r/politics/comments/38d31b/elon_musk_if_i_cared_about_subsidies_i_would_have/

What?  ""Lack"" of progress?  Batteries steadily improve 7-10% per year.  That's quite a lot of progress.  I have no idea what you're talking about.

>charging times

Well, Tesla debuted the supercharger at 90kW two years ago, and now the stations they're installing are 135kW.  Further, I have never spent any time charging my car, whereas you have spent time filling your car up at a gas station.  I have in fact saved time.  So, I'm not sure how to improve from zero.

>or cycles

Again, just because you are not aware of progress does not mean it's not happening.  It is.  Do you have some sort of knowledge which suggests that there has ever been a problem in terms of lack of cycles in EVs?  Because there isn't one.  Unless you're talking about first-gen Leafs in hot climates.

No. People are looking at monthly payments. When you drop ~~$200~~ **$100** from your monthly gas bill, you can afford a modestly higher payment.

> Additionally, I know the majority of charging stations are currently free,

Not the majority. A very small sliver are free and only in between cities. The cost of electricity for a car is less than half of the gasoline cost even if you pay for every watt.

> At that point what will be charged for a Kwh? That remains to be seen, but you can bet the coal industry will push for 2-4x what it costs for home usage.

Gas prices fluctuate wildly over time. You've seen gas go from almost $4/gallon down to damn near $1/gallon, back up to $3.80, down to $2, back up to $3. That is unpredictable. Electricity is not unpredictable.

Your home rate doesn't change more than once every year or few years, if that. Most people charge at home. The residential rate for electricity is *higher* than for commercial. A business can install charging stations and charge whatever they want, but they don't have to gouge to make a profit. With competition, some will try, others will make it up in volume.

> The savings might be nice now, but that is destined to change.

It *IS* destined to change, but not for the worse. Batteries and charging systems are constantly getting better and cheaper. We are adding electrical capacity far faster than cars are able to consume it. More electric cars means lower gas demand, so if you don't make the switch, hopefully you'll still enjoy the savings.

> even in a town as ""green"" as Eugene Or I don't see that many electrics on the road.

I see at least a few every day in the suburbs of Seattle. A Tesla or two, maybe a Volt or Leaf. Thing is a lot of electric cars you won't notice because they are built on a gas car's frame. I think the other thing with Eugene is that it's a tad far from Portland for most electric cars.

You use that car to prove your concept, and dispel the misconceptions about EVs, that they are slow and can't run for very long.  

Then you take the lessons learned from that first car and you build a less expensive, mainstream, medium production sedan, that can compete with high end gas cars on their own turf.  You use this car to refine your manufacturing processes, and to build your reputation.

The third step is the inexpensive, high production volume car that will appeal to anyone looking at purchasing a new vehicle.

Aside from all of that Musk released all of Tesla's patents which is a huge step in helping other companies ""catch up"" on the engineering side of the electric car market. This will allow for more designs to come out, cheaper cars to be made, more competition and ultimately (which is where this can help Tesla) more charging stations.

Also, and I hadn't responded to this earlier in your post because I didn't have time:

>A car is going to need 300+miles capacity and no more than a 15min charge time before folks will start to seriously consider purchasing an EV over a hybrid or classic option

This is not the case.  It's like saying that nobody will accept a smartphone because dumbphones can last several days between charges, whereas smartphones need to be charged every night.  The thing is: you don't need multiple days of charge.  Just like you don't need 300 miles, and you don't need it to happen in 15 minutes.  If you have an EV, right now, you will spend *less* time fueling your car than if you have an ICE.  Because your car fills up when you're at home, doing other things, like sleeping, which most people do occasionally.  Instead of having to go out of your way to get to a gas station once a week (or however often).  On the rare once-in-a-lifetime occasions that you drive over 300 miles in a day, there are quick chargers available so you can fill up while eating, stretching, going to the bathroom, etc., all other things which most people do occasionally.  There are only a few corner cases these days for which EVs are not superior.  The average driver is not one of them.

Besides, there *is* a car with 300 miles capacity and 15-30 minute charging.  It's the one we're talking about in this article.  It sells less units than the one with 84 miles range (but also 15-30 minute charging), because people realize they don't need 300 miles and 15-30 minutes and would rather have something more affordable.

So it's far more likely that your realization will not happen along with technology, but at a rate similar to smartphones, or as you say marijuana, or gay marriage, or whatever, where we see rapid acceptance once people start to realize ""oh, these things are fine huh"" instead of treating them as some foreign object.",politics,t2_85qzs,38d31b,crvrmfz,/r/politics/comments/38d31b/elon_musk_if_i_cared_about_subsidies_i_would_have/crvrmfz/,/r/politics/comments/38d31b/elon_musk_if_i_cared_about_subsidies_i_would_have/

In return the overall efficiency of an electric motor in terms of energy to motion is actually quite good and so the energy stored in a Tesla battery is actually put to very good use. Overall I would bet the overall efficiency would be not great but not bad in terms of fuel --> output motion ratio when compared to a standard combustion engine.

Carbon dioxide is a known greenhouse gas and while it is necessary for plant growth it's excess has been linked to global warming and climate change with (I believe in the most recent meta-study) 7 sigma significance; that is virtually irrefutable statistical evidence. The reason I care about carbon is that even though mining can be regionally quite harmful, carbon dioxide is a global contaminant that has global ramifications. In fact minimizing carbon dioxide emissions is probably the greatest challenge that we currently face as a species with multi-trillion dollar consequences if we fail to deal with it well.

What are you talking about?  The Smart ED is 139/mo.  There are very few leases which are cheaper than that, and certainly when you take running costs into account.  Further, how are ""poor people"" subsidizing this?  Dirty air, global warming, pollution, etc., disproportionately affect the poor, and thus the poor are subsidizing ICE cars.  EV subsidies work to reduce that.  Thus, it is a benefit to the poor.

Your point would only stand if we did not have people pushing to generate energy from non-fossil sources, and we do. People are pushing for more renewable sources and the technology required to make that cheep and effective. A good example of this is actually Tesla's new home battery. Using solar to power your home is a joke if you don't have significant power storage, and the Tesla home battery is a step in that direction. 

Is this technology good enough? Nope, but it never will be unless we work on it. The ""fancy toys for rich people"" phase is just how this always starts. Computers, phones, cars, trains, and planes all started as far too expensive for the average person to use, they are now all common place. 

>you've just moved pollution from the tailpipe of your car to the smokestack of the power plant.

This is also a poor argument. It's much easier to work clean the output and improve the efficiency of a single power plant then thousands of cars. Also most electric is from coal in the US, that's at least a domestic product

>why should we subsidize this? How does this make the world better?

Because it'll speed up the creation of an infrastructure that will get us off of foreign oil and eventually fossil fuels. A better question is why are we spending more money on subsidizing fossil fuels than renewable energy sources? The fossil fuel industry is an established industry that needs no financial help. While the renewable industry is a new industry that has a huge amount of research that it's working on that will benefit everyone regardless of how much they believe in global warming.

Spare us the China cheerleading.

How many tens of thousands died from lung cancer, or any disease which could have been easily prevented, or treated, simply because they couldn't afford healthcare? How many tens thousands have died in needless wars? 

Do you really think life isn't cheap in the US?

You have slave labour in the prison system. You have your entire work culture so fucked up, for so long, that you people think it's normal to live that way.

You have people who can't afford to live properly while holding two jobs. People who literally run their bodies into the ground, and hope they don't sick because they can't afford to get well. People who dedicate their entire lives to work, sacrificing their personal relationships/family for what, exactly? For nothing.

You can't really bitch about being fucked over at work because you'll just get fired, and get replaced some some newbie who will work for cheaper. Your work culture is a fucking meat grinder, and you think the US values life? If the US valued life, you would get more days off in a year, you would get paid maternity leave for both parents, you wouldn't have states that allow termination for no reason... The list goes on, and on.

China deserves some cheerleading in certain areas. They also deserve major reforms in other areas. But the US isn't some utopia of worker rights, environmental awareness, and quality of life.

Nobody goes on road trips with any frequency.  It's like less than .01% of a car's use or something.

> If you did, you would realize it is not the journey, but the destination, and an affordable car with a 300mile range is a pretty standard necessity.

Correct!  Which is why it's not a necessity.  Because if it's the journey, then you have plenty of time to make the journey.  Which means you have plenty of time to charge, and you don't need to do a balls-out cannonball run where you drive 500 miles straight without stopping, which everyone seems to think is how road trips work and thinks they go on them every day (they don't).

This is an old opinion article which is and always has been wrong.  Particularly considering ICE vehicles are subsidized *much* more than EVs - and thus, Tesla *saves* us all money by selling cars which have less subsidy than the average car.  Which you can see above.  In things that are not opinion articles.

>Nothing affects the environment worse than mining

I'd like to hear how you calculated that.  And also I'd like to hear how you manage to get fossil fuels and manage to build ICE cars without mining anything.

Do you know how lithium mining is done, by the way?  It's salt flats.  Not mountaintop removal, not deepwater drilling, not oil sand extraction, not fracking.  Those last three are fossil fuel industry actions.  Which are heavily subsidized.  Which is what we're talking about.

And I bet you support all of them, while claiming in this comment that you care about the environment, which is quite an odd argument to make, because it's clear that you don't, so why do you even bother to pretend?  I mean, at least you acknowledge that having an openly anti-environment viewpoint is too outrageous even for someone of your ilk, so I guess that's progress.

If you buy a Tesla (or any electric vehicle) in most states, you will receive a tax credit. You also receive a federal tax credit. The fact that it is a tax credit is important as tax credits reduce the amount of taxes you owe by the *full amount* of the credit (this is not the case for a deduction). You only receive these credits if you purchase an electric vehicle. Therefore, by purchasing a Telsa, consumers receive a tax break equal to the amount of the credit (and if you're buying a Telsa, you will owe at least Federal taxes).

For illustration, let's assume these credits total $1,000 (in reality they're more). A rational consumer would be roughly indifferent to buying a Tesla for $71,000 with a $1,000 tax credit as they would to buying a Tesla for $70,000 with no tax credit. Therefore Tesla, if they are acting rationally, would determine the price that consumers are willing to pay without any tax credits and then raise their price by the amount of tax credits consumers are actually receiving (because with the tax credits consumers don't care that the price is higher - they'll get that money back). Therefore the tax credits can be viewed as a direct subsidy to Tesla routed through consumers.

This is *only* the case because you cannot get these tax credits without purchasing an electric vehicle. They are directly tied. In the case of gasoline subsidies, there are more reasons to buy gas other than a car (lawnmower, rv, snowblower, generator, etc). Cars are the main reason, but not the only reason. In addition, the money saved on gas is not tied to the purchase of a car so it's far more difficult for car manufacturers to raise their price to capture all of that subsidy - consumers can use their savings on gas to buy other things. Tesla can capture all of the subsidy because you cannot get the subsidy without buying a Tesla. It's further complicated by the fact that the credit is not given to consumers in that case - it's given directly to gas producers to artificially deflate their prices. Couple that with fluctuations on gas prices and it would be difficult to say how rational consumers will actually act in terms of ""savings"" that they may not be realizing they are getting and that may change over time. Car manufacturers likely *do* benefit from it, but by how much is very unclear, and there's no way it's the full amount of the subsidy like that article claims.",politics,t2_85qzs,38d31b,crvp7jq,/r/politics/comments/38d31b/elon_musk_if_i_cared_about_subsidies_i_would_have/crvp7jq/,/r/politics/comments/38d31b/elon_musk_if_i_cared_about_subsidies_i_would_have/

So what you're saying is that the average person then receives far more than $17,000 in gasoline subsidies?  Yes, that's a problem.

>Car manufacturers likely do benefit from it

The lifetime cost of the car is being lowered by much more than $7500.  Were the subsidy not there, the TCO of the car would be >17000 higher on average.  Therefore, the car's being subsidized.

This is a R&D project in my mind plain and simple, just in beta. Some supercapacitor, or battery gel or mesh will make them charge and hold juice for powering buses, big rigs, hoverboards, you name it. Computers and this very Internet started with government subsidies, heck just look up how many great inventions NASA developed.

If you want research then you should just give the money to universities. They are much more likely to come out with innovations. 

>What exactly are all the oil companies offering all of humanity, pray tell?

They offer the fuel that has saved billions of lives and pushed most of the third world out of poverty. They produce the material (plastic) that is essential to almost every single product you use. I am not defending the shitty environmental record and hope they will eventually become obsolete but they did good for humanity.

>His sleek rockets have successfully launched dozens of satellites, and cargo to the ISS (and for cheap).

Pretty cool. Not a reason to subsidize his other businesses.

>His car blows away all others on safety, reliability, and i've seen them at a drag race, just wow. good American cars, new models and developments every few month,

Absolutely agree. They are great cars if you are wealthy enough to afford them. They would probably sell without subsidies.

They are not fully open. Public declarations are not legally binding contracts. He is using the same tactic that Twitter and Google have done of making his products standard so that he can't be sued for his own patent transgressions. Still, it is a pretty good deal.

>As a tax payer, who would I wish to give my money to?

And one could argue that they increase the demand for fuel, but not necessarily the demand for cars (at least not in a 1:1 manner). Many people can decrease the amount they drive a car, but not give up a car completely.

And if we're going to include subsidies given to fuel for a car in the total cost of ownership, Tesla is getting a ton of subsidies through government payments and regulation to electric utilities to keep the cost of electricity stable (some of which are...fuel subsidies).

1) Jesus is magic: Jesus walks on earth, performing miracles. Thus his significance is based on his 'miraculousness'. Thus Jesus heals lepers because he's magic and he can.

2) Jesus is an idea: Jesus appears to the apostles in a series of revelatory hallucinations, similar to the burning bush and Moses. Thus the life and teachings of Jesus are automatically more abstract than the literal text of the bible. 

When Jesus heals lepers, its a metaphor: a larger statement about how we should treat the unfortunate. If Jesus, an extension of God himself, is willing to put time and effort to heal the sick, shouldn't we help the sick whenever we're able. Same goes for the miracle of the loaves: we need to feed the starving, *even if it takes a miracle*. 


As a lifelong atheist, this blew my mind. Suddenly, you can get away from arguing about whether or not someone's imaginary friend exists. Instead there's a bigger, more important, discussion about how to lead a good life. Here's where, as an atheist, I can see the value of religious faith: some people find it helpful. They might get some weird ideas, but on the whole they find it makes their day-to-day life better, and helps them rationalize altruistic behavior. 

People get so hung up on arguing the *existence* of deities, they forget to consider the *utility* of deities. Kinda like how the Mormons keep [digging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology_and_the_Book_of_Mormon) for stuff mentioned in the Book of Mormon. They will **never** find the physical evidence they're looking for, but that shouldn't matter. Rather, the important question is how does the Mormon lifestyle (or any religious lifestyle) improve people's lives?

Alright, so you're saying I should have said TCO rather than purchase price.  That's fine.  I get what you're saying now.

But this is still an artificial lowering of the cost of the car.  It's passing a large part of the cost of ownership into use, rather than purchase price.  Since consumers often give precedence to original purchase price over running costs, this is an even more effective subsidy, particularly as compared to EVs which naturally have lower running costs.  So the only way to make it fair for the EVs is to depress the purchase price of the car.  Subsidizing the running costs wouldn't really do anything, since a) there's little running cost to subsidize anyway, and b) consumers, again, give precedence to purchase price.

That said, the total subsidy for an ICE vehicle is still much higher.

>And one could argue that they increase the demand for fuel, but not necessarily the demand for cars (at least not in a 1:1 manner)

The two are definitely tied.  Anyway, I just read a stat, which is not purely accurate, but apparently there is a ""rule of thumb"" in the auto industry that every ~5k reduction in a car's price results in a ~2x increase in the amount of people who can afford it.  Thus, a 17k reduction in TCO must increase the addressable audience by quite a lot.  In fact, more than 1:1 in that case.  Maybe the resulting profits aren't 1:1, but the demand increase is extreme.

>Tesla is getting a ton of subsidies through government payments to electric utilities

That's covered in the link.  ""In comparison, emissions from energy to power an electric Nissan Leaf would cost us $840 even if purely powered by coal, and $290 if fueled by electricity supplied entirely from natural gas.""  So a *lot* less.  And of course there are no embedded subsidies for health/pollution if the cars are powered by solar, wind, etc., and 30% of EV owners in CA have solar.  There are subsidies for solar panels....but, those are correctional, to put it closer to an equal playing field with dirty energy.  Were there no subsidies for either, solar would come out even more advantageous, as is the case with EVs.",politics,t2_85qzs,38d31b,crvralw,/r/politics/comments/38d31b/elon_musk_if_i_cared_about_subsidies_i_would_have/crvralw/,/r/politics/comments/38d31b/elon_musk_if_i_cared_about_subsidies_i_would_have/

I understand it alright, but the market isn't really the base of this discussion but company profitability.

Josephus is where it gets more interesting; textual analysis suggests that there may have 'been an original nugget of non-interpolated reference to Jesus in the text, but we cannot be certain, as it is equally possible the interpolation was coincidentally or deliberately well enough executed to suggest that. 

However, to believe in the original nugget of truth, we'll also have to completely ignore the fact that the next paragraph begins with ""At this time, there was another calamity""; reference to a wise man and a doer of good works, even if just someone the people thought was the son of god, does not a calamity make.

There are also writings that likely would have referenced this 1st century source during the 2nd and 3rd century had it 'been available to them, and are known to have had access to Josephus' work, but references to this paragraph only begin to surface in the 4th century. 

It's also kind of peculiar that Josephus writes only a short, offhanded snippet about the supposed true messiah of the Christians, and goes more in depth describing some tabloid-esque sex scandal on the next page... especially given that he seemed to like lambasting all the other messianic claimant.

And here's the kicker; even if Josephus was a completely trustworthy and reliable reference, it still doesn't prove anything. Josephus wrote about Jesus some 60 years after his supposed death. It's all hearsay.

Worse yet, there is a wealth of philosophers and writers who both lived during his supposed lifetime, and in his supposed locale, who had plenty of reason to write about him, and whose writings survive to this day.

""Doing some simple math here, Netflix's streaming liabilities seem to be almost $200 per subscriber. However, the company's costs have been growing rapidly as the company pays more for newer shows while continuing to pay for older ones.

However, let's do some math here. Let's assume Netflix reaches 150 million subscribers and maintains content costs of $200 per subscriber with no other overhead, expansion or server costs.

That means the company is generating revenues of $18 billion per year and has content costs of $30 billion per year. This represents significant losses of $12 billion per year. Netflix needs to find a way to reduce its content costs by 40%, assuming it has no other costs, just to break-even.""",politics,t2_85qzs,38d31b,crww4zz,/r/politics/comments/38d31b/elon_musk_if_i_cared_about_subsidies_i_would_have/crww4zz/,/r/politics/comments/38d31b/elon_musk_if_i_cared_about_subsidies_i_would_have/

With the promise of almost lightning-quick transportation, the company attracted the attention of governments across the world and has raised more than $245  million in capital from investors in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and China.

>There’s one investor, though, that the company consistently keeps off its website and releases: the Russian Direct Investment Fund, one of the country’s sovereign wealth funds, and the only one under U.S. sanctions. One economist based in Moscow—Chris Weafer, a senior partner at Macro Advisory—noted that almost every deal struck by the Russian Direct Investment Fund involves at least some input by President Vladimir Putin himself. He described RDIF as a kind of financial “consigliere” of the Kremlin.

>Musk spokesmen said the billionaire is not involved with Virgin Hyperloop One. He heads the Boring Company, which is on its way to building its own Hyperloop-style system.

>Two years after the Russian Direct Investment Fund’s investment in Virgin Hyperloop One, U.S. officials say they have become increasingly wary of the deal and others that include Russian sovereign wealth.

They knew the potential for damage from shedding foam existed before it happened:
>Bipod ramp insulation had been observed falling off, in whole or in part, on four previous flights: STS-7 (1983), STS-32 (1990), STS-50 (1992) and most recently STS-112 (just two launches before STS-107). All affected shuttle missions completed successfully. NASA management came to refer to this phenomenon as ""foam shedding"". As with the O-ring erosion problems that ultimately doomed the Space Shuttle Challenger, NASA management became accustomed to these phenomena when no serious consequences resulted from these earlier episodes. This phenomenon was termed ""normalization of deviance"" by sociologist Diane Vaughan in her book on the Challenger launch decision process.[7]

NASA administration prevented inspection of the possible damage:
>In a risk-management scenario similar to the Challenger disaster, NASA management failed to recognize the relevance of engineering concerns for safety and suggestions for imaging to inspect possible damage, and failed to respond to engineers' requests about the status of astronaut inspection of the left wing. Engineers made three separate requests for Department of Defense (DOD) imaging of the shuttle in orbit to determine damage more precisely. While the images were not guaranteed to show the damage, the capability existed for imaging of sufficient resolution to provide meaningful examination. NASA management did not honor the requests and in some cases intervened to stop the DOD from assisting.[12] ",politics,t2_14jan,8he0jr,dyj9rh2,/r/politics/comments/8he0jr/elon_musks_spacex_is_using_a_powerful_rocket/dyj9rh2/,/r/politics/comments/8he0jr/elon_musks_spacex_is_using_a_powerful_rocket/

As you know there is always a risk and cost benefit for science and in particular space science.

You know better than most the cost in terms on less science done by having manned missions, you know fully well in that case most of the system you need are for the preservation of life and to ensure the safe return on the humans. This is completely counter to the goal if that goal is go gain as much data as you can for the lest risk to life for the lowest cost.

There is the argument that it is always better to have humans there kicking rocks, and on an emotional level that is subjectively right, but on a purely scientific level having humans there is only a burden on the science. If you put humans on Mars, you would still need the instruments of a rover to do good science, making the human redundant.

Any space exploration that requires a human presence is unnecessarily putting lives at risk.

It also shows that even smart and otherwise rational scientists can act in irrational and unscientific ways. No scientific discovery or great scientific idea with worth dying for. A rational scientists or engineer would understand that if the goal is the gather data the safest, cheapest and smartest way to do with is with remotely controlled robotic craft.

We are beyond the days where if the technology failed you could hope for effective human intervention, humans simply cannot manually operate modern spacecraft.

That leaves the only rational reason to send people into space is for tourist and t-shirt value. And people willingly do dangerous things all the time just for fun, they usually ensure to the best of their ability that it is still within an acceptable level of safety.

I used to skydive, quite a dangerous sport, but I took all manner of measures to ensure I would live, and I simply would not have jumped in those assurances were not there.

In other words, the US makes more electricity from *burning actual gasoline* than it does from solar power.

Do not fool yourself into thinking that by driving an electric car you've stopped burning fossil fuels.  You've simply shifted the *place* where the fossil fuels are burned.

edit 2 : the reason why natural gas is so high on that list -- and climbing -- is because fracking has reduced the cost and electric plants are switching from coal to gas.

If you want to understand his position, I recommend watching **this great 5 minute video where Elon talks about this issue** [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znukFtaWPAw)

I think a problem with the Guardian article is that it doesn't mention Elon's assertion that fossil fuel subsidies are around **Six Trillion dollars a year.** (IMF estimate of 5.3 Trillion dollars below)

New to reddit and couldn't help but *throw caution to the wind and jump in.* 

IMHO markets are enormously powerful at organising and achieving outcomes - if the price signal reflects the true cost of that resource or product or service (ie a price on carbon) govt. can step aside and let the market figure out HOW to solve the problem of climate change caused by carbon. 

Lobbying in politics impairs many market forces and this is a very good example of such. For example, 99% of studies between 1991 and 2012 are making a case for climate change (source: [slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2012/12/11/climate_change_denial_why_don_t_they_publish_scientific_papers.html) ), and yet we still have a significant portion of the population denying this.  A [Drexel University study](http://www.drexel.edu/~/media/Files/now/pdfs/Institutionalizing%20Delay%20-%20Climatic%20Change.ashx) from Jan 2013 has determined that there are  91 climate change counter-movement (CCCM) organizations with **a total income of more than $7 billion over the eight year period** 2003–2010, with an annual average income exceeding $900 million, whose role is to counter the scientific arguments of climate change. More is reported about this in the [Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/20/conservative-groups-1bn-against-climate-change), with further reporting about dark money in [Scientific American.](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dark-money-funds-climate-change-denial-effort/) An anecdote of this would be that a town hall is held, and there is a few people walking around with megaphones broadcasting their opinions, drowning out the overwhelming consensus of hundreds of people in the meeting.

If you're interested in this climate change denial campaign by many companies standing to benefit from delayed climate change action, check out the documentary film [Merchants of Doubt.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8ii9zGFDtc) More is covered about this film [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJIW5yVk__w)

Note also Elon's comment regarding externalities. [Externalities are an inherent problem in markets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTD5Bn1m0) that we need to deal with more effectively if we are to have an efficient market, and not have it damaging the society.  By dumping carbon into the atmosphere there is a damage to the environment, and unless this is priced into the cost of the activity, product or service, it's an externality. We may deny or refuse these costs right now, but they will definitely be felt by our children and their children and successive generations if/when fossil fuels have run out and our atmosphere and environment is unable to support the life that exists today. 

Useful in the discussion and the future energy market is a book [Clean Disruption of Energy and Transportation: How Silicon Valley Will Make Oil, Nuclear, Natural Gas, Coal, Electric Utilities and Conventional Cars Obsolete by 2030](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Disruption-Energy-Transportation-Conventional-ebook/dp/B00L2M7UK8) by [Tony Seba](http://www.amazon.com/Tony-Seba/e/B004MIX95O/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1) 
and/or this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxryv2XrnqM) he gives describing the likelihood that **solar/battery will drive fossil fuels into obselence in the next decade or two** - while Govt policy can drive this, the power of the market forces and projected future prices may very well achive this outcome. 

Let's discuss more facts and data.

The largest ones are things like the Strategic Petroleum Reserve which is a national defense program but since it's the government buying oil it also counts as a subsidy.  Then you have tax free fuel for farm and fishing, which also counts as a subsidy since it lowers the cost of fuel, but the reason it is tax free is because that fuel is not being used for transportation on public roads.  The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps the poor afford heat.  You have foreign policy to help developing nation with aid from energy production to infrastructure or to reduce energy costs.   Finally you have all the normal business subsidies that apply to all businesses including the fossil fuel industry.  These include things like capital investment tax benefits, DOE low interest loans, tax deductions for US manufacturers etc...  There are some subsidies that do directly target the fossil fuel industry, but even these make some sense.  Things like allowing the fossil fuel industry to fully depreciate an oil rig when a well runs dry so that the rig can be immediately removed.  I'm sure there are some programs that are the heinous subsidies that most people think of, but by and large they are either common sense programs, or they apply to all industry and not the fossil fuel industry in particular.

*Edit - It might be helpful to define the term subsidy.  Oil Change International has been one of the sources politicians use when they throw out the $X billion dollar numbers for fossil fuel subsidies.  They define subsidy as ""any government action that lowers the cost of fossil fuel energy production, raises the price received by energy producers or lowers the price paid by energy consumers.""",politics,t2_85qzs,4i4szy,d2vb5qv,/r/politics/comments/4i4szy/elon_musk_we_need_a_revolt_against_the_fossil/d2vb5qv/,/r/politics/comments/4i4szy/elon_musk_we_need_a_revolt_against_the_fossil/

When the cost of solar &amp; battery drops below 6c/KWH, it will be cheaper for many people to produce their own power than to buy off the grid, because the cost of delivery of electricity over the grid is around 6c/KWH. There is still a place for utility generation and the main method of production will be solar &amp; battery.

His book [Clean Disruption of Energy and Transportation: How Silicon Valley Will Make Oil, Nuclear, Natural Gas, Coal, Electric Utilities and Conventional Cars Obsolete by 2030] (http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Disruption-Energy-Transportation-Conventional/dp/0692210539?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=clean%20disruption&amp;qid=1462589361&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1 ) discusses this in detail.

Useful: Nuclear has a negative learning curve for the past 30 years  - The more we research and deploy the technology, the more expensive the technology gets. Not sure if Thorium or new technologies are going to change this assertion, or if they can do so before Solar elipses them completely.

By your source:

>Heat rate is **one measure** of the efficiency of a generator or power plant that converts a fuel into heat and into electricity. 

You mention modern cars are around the same efficiency. I calculated 2014 centralized generation was around 10-15% more efficient.

>Modern gasoline engines have a maximum thermal efficiency of about 25% to 30% when used to power a car.

What you are missing is that these 20% numbers include old cars that predate advances like direct injection (EcoBoost) and variable timing, include energy delivered to the wheel so include losses in the transmission (or worse are calculated from mpg), and include large cars and trucks where battery is not even an option because of size and weight.  And most cars don't run the engine at peak efficiency.

These 20% numbers argue that complicated transmissions or running at non-peak are ""part of"" the engine so fair to include, but these losses really are just in ways the ICE engine is used.  For instance series hybrids don't need complicated transmissions and can run at peak efficiency, so they can be cleaner than an EV charging from fossil fuel power plants.

The claim that EVs are cleaner even when powered by a fossil grid because power plants are more efficient is not true.

When used to power a car -- a traditional car with transmission gearbox and all that.  They go on to say ""at idle, the thermal efficiency is zero"".  So this efficiency is based on how efficient the engine is *when used a particular way*, not how efficient the engine itself actually is.

The actual modern car engine is very efficient and comparable to fossil fuel power plants when it's used in a hybrid.

We will move on from fossil fuels when the alternative is cheaper and more viable. Humans are cheap and lazy, and in an efficient free market, they will pick the most convenient alternative. If electric was even close to being viable (by the way, I think it's great all the progress on alternative energy we are making, but I'm coming from a realist standpoint not an idealist), we would all be driving electric cars.

Reality is, beyond fuel sources, petroleum products are used for almost every single thing in daily use. Plastics (from your cell phone, to your computer, to the plastic cheetos bag at the store) all are petroleum derivatives. Makeup is made with petroleum products. So many things are. Every luxury of the modern world we enjoy was made available because of fossil fuels. The food at your table was delivered from the farmer to the grocer in a big truck that used fossil fuels, and that truck was assembled at a shop using parts that were delivered using fossil fuels.

Electric cars are a great start, but they are currently expensive and only viable for personal transportation. Large trucks that carry the goods we use require too much power for electricity currently. Airplanes are another example. It will be a LOOONG time before airplanes come off of fossil fuels. Without the fossil fuels they use, you probably wouldn't be able to go anywhere in this world. I know I wouldn't have been able to attend a better university across the continent, I'd be stuck in my crappy little home town. Business travel relies on that.

Anyways, I'm rambling. The point I'm trying to make is that calling for an abrupt stop to the fossil fuels industry is moronic. We NEED to make progress in sustainable and alternative energies, but to drop it right now would mean an immediate downgrade in the quality of life that we all live. Are we ready for that? I think most people wouldn't want that. The cost of living would shoot through the roof! It's better to let the technology progess and it will naturally out-compete with the oil industry and defeat it long-term. 

The fossil fuel companies aren't evil, they are just meeting the demand that we as a species have created for ourselves. We're in a free market, and demand will be met no matter what. It's not their fault for producing fossil fuels, its OURS. We enjoy the lives we do because of fossil fuels, yet we barely know it.

Imagine if all the people who are pushing oil industry first would switch and push alternative energy. Fossil would be gone in five years.


Now, imagine you are Elon Musk. You've become so successful that money is always there for you. You can buy anything, absolutely anything. 


You see the world so fucked up as it is every day, and this time you can actually do something to change that. Who wouldn't take a chance like that?


So you invest all your money and energy into alternative energy. You know that 98% of all the wars going on right now are because of the black gold, and the alternative energy sources are the only option (except nuclear) to stop most of the chain of evil that the black gold produces.

Of course fossil fuels have been massively important to industrialization and making the world more connected. But I think the economic advantages of EV's are going to catch up faster than most people think. 

Consider that true electric cars have only been around for a few years and are already becoming quite common. Imagine in 5-10 years when people who bought in early see their investments pay off in the form of cheaper fuel and better reliability due to fewer moving parts. Imagine when you can buy a used Tesla from a dealer for a fraction of the original price, an advantage currently held by traditional vehicles. You can assume that as companies become more experienced with EV's and more infrastructure is built to produce and manufacture them, the quality and price will also improve. 

Before Musk became a household name, EV's were barely more than a fad. They were half-assed attempts to compete in environmentally conscious markets, and to give the companies an appearance of morality. Musk said, ""Fuck that, I'm not going to wait for society to get on board. I'm going to drag the auto industry into the future whether people are ready or not."" It's a great example of ""if you want something done right, do it yourself.""

The myopic world view many people have here is frustrating. Natural gas is a bridge fuel that must play a role if we are to reduce carbon emissions.

>Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, told Gizmodo on Thursday that Moran was “paid by the UAW to join Tesla and agitate for a union. He doesn’t really work for us, he works for the UAW”.

>Moran said he had been congratulated by fellow factory workers since publishing a blog citing preventable injuries at the plant, mandatory overtime and workers being paid less than the auto industry average.

So someone complains about injuries, and Musks response is not concern for improving workplace safety but to denounce the employee as a union agitator?

Burn in hell Musk.

Money gives the nasty parts of humanity an outlet. Socialism devolves into tyranny often because it does not account for the nasty selfishness many have, and the many selfish people work to subvert the system because they are not willing to act in the benefit of society out of the goodness of their hearts and wish to destroy a system that stifles them. Look no further than Allendes chile, which gave way to Pinochet, or the Soviet Union, or mao. Socialism works only as long as those in power are benevolent, and those not in power are placated. 

Socialism puts more power into the hands of the governing body. It seems to me that many of the same issues that capitalism has, people acting in self interest at the expense of others, would still exist under socialism. Many of our issues exist because those in power are heartless, and I kind of doubt that putting into place a system that empowers the few in governance would make them suddenly selfless. Many of my socialist friends are the same ones who, rightly, criticize the corruption in our political system. It's a catch 22 of sorts, and though socialism is in theory amazing, it does not work when the evil of humanity is thrown into the mix.

Reddit for some reason has this idea that socialism means ""anything that the government does,"" but that's entirely untrue. Socialists want democratic worker ownership of the means of production (productive property like factories and all other workplaces) and an end to wage labor, among other things. The government building roads and giving people healthcare has nothing inherently to do with socialism, even though you'll find that socialists all support universal healthcare.

People get confused about this because of the massive bureaucracy of states like the USSR, but the USSR was never actually socialist because state ownership of productive property isn't the same thing as worker ownership. That's more like state capitalism, where the state acts as the sole private owner.

The USA frequently overthrew foreign governments that went against the 'Washington consensus' in order to preserve ""a more favorable investment climate"" - keeping the country open for resource extraction and investment, rolling back labor and environmental regulations, keeping wages and interest rates low, borrowing large sums of money to spend on industrial developments for foreign investors and security forces to keep population in line, not to mention plain old fashioned graft.

It's just not realistic, for a number of reasons. Tell me: how do you imagine that system would come to existence? And how would it stay in existence? 

I read jacobin. I know that the USSR wasn't really socialism, and I'm pretty sure you know that I knew that, or else the reference wouldn't be sandwiched between Pinochet and mao. The point I was making was that attempts to enact socialism are doomed. 

It's just frustrating speaking to socialists. It's like speaking to utopians. Many people would, in reality, love a society where the people control the means of production and everyone lives in harmony and it's a barter system and yada Yada yada. It just will never, ever happen. People are too evil. There's too much shit entrenched in our society. People like their shit too much. It would require a revolution, and you wouldn't be able to win. To me it's like people who say ""why don't we just print more money?! Then everyone would be rich!"" 

A political ideology that is hellbent on destroying capitalism is ultimately very harmful to the most unfortunate of our society because they do not believe in the system. If you do not believe in the system, you refuse to enact change through the system. We are lucky enough to, theoretically, live in one of the only societies in human history where we choose our own leaders, where people aren't dying in wars very often, where no one lives in outright slavery. There's a lot not to take for granted. There are ways to change our system from within the system. It's designed for that. There aren't many ways to change our system without the system, besides by war and tyranny.

What I'm saying is that arguing for more programs to help the poor, arguing against privatization, arguing for universal healthcare and less expensive or free state universities, all of that is noble and realistic.

Lets have a look one just one country where the government was overthrown in order to preserve ""a more favourable investment climate""

>Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship is another famous success story. Under the heading “Tyrant’s `Success’ Leaves 7 of 12 Million Chileans Poor,” Antonio Garza Morales reports in Excelsior that “the social cost which has been paid by the Chilean people is the highest in Latin America,” with *the number of poor rising from 1 million after Allende to 7 million today, while the population remained stable at 12 million.* Christian Democratic Party leader Senator Anselmo Sule, returned from exile, says that *economic growth that benefits 10 percent of the population has been achieved (Pinochet’s official institutions agree), but development has not.* Unless the economic disaster for the majority is remedied, “we are finished,” he adds. According to David Felix, “Chile, hit especially hard in the 1982-84 period, is now growing faster than during the preceding decade of the Chicago Boys,” enthralled by the free market ideology that is, indeed, highly beneficial for some: the wealthy, crucially including foreign investors. *Chile’s recovery, Felix argues, can be traced to “a combination of severe wage repression by the Pinochet regime, an astutely managed bailout of the bankrupt private sector by the economic team that replaced the discredited Chicago Boys, and access to unusually generous lending by the international financial institutions,” much impressed by the favorable climate for business operations.*

>Environmental degradation is also a severe problem in Chile. The Chilean journal Apsi devoted a recent issue to the environmental crisis accelerated by the “radical neoliberalism” of the period following the U.S.-backed coup that overthrew the parliamentary democracy. Recent studies show that about half the country is becoming a desert, a problem that “seems much farther away than the daily poisoning of those who live in Santiago,” the capital city, which competes with Sao Paolo (Brazil) and Mexico City for the pollution prize for the hemisphere (for the world, the journal alleges). “The liquid that emerges from the millions of faucets in the homes and alleys of Santiago have levels of copper, iron, magnesium and lead which exceed by many times the maximum tolerable norms.” The land that “supplies the fruits and vegetables of the Metropolitan Region are irrigated with waters that exceed by 1,000 times the maximum quantity of coliforms acceptable,” which is why Santiago “has levels of hepatitis, typhoid, and parasites which are not seen in any other part of the continent” (one of every three children has parasites in the capital). *Economists and environmentalists attribute the problem to the “development model,” crucially, its “transnational style,” “in which the most important decisions tend to be adopted outside the ambit of the countries themselves,” consistent with the assigned “function” of the Third World: to serve the needs of the industrial West.*

When you look at where the money flows with automation, it's not out of the hands of the working class and into the hands of the intellectual class - it's out of the hands of the working class and into the hands of the people who control the intellectual property.

This isn't all that much different from the original Gilded Age.  When Marx was railing about control of the means of production, he was observing that control of the tools of production led to extreme concentration of wealth.  Well, in the modern day, the tools of production are intellectual property - and control over intellectual property has created a society where wealth is endlessly stackable.

With real property, you still need people to operate and protect your property.  With intellectual property, all you need is a piece of paper filed with the government.

Indeed, even the *term* intellectual property gives a clue.  Patent/trademark/etc. law explicitly exists to spur innovation.  It does not exist to grant exclusive access to ideas in perpetuity to those with sufficient legal funds.

4617,None,http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/04/elon-musk-robots-will-take-your-jobs-government-will-have-to-pay-your-wage.html,"Post-scarcity *is* kind of a rough term for it. I think ""transitional-scarcity"" is probably more accurate to describe what we're looking at. There is still a cap based on available raw resources, but the transformation of resources into consumer goods becomes essentially-labor free. Design and management still require human input, and all human-service jobs still exist, but the basic process of extracting raw resources and physically transforming them into consumer goods, including transportation and delivery, requires almost no labor.

It's the first half of the scarcity trap, and companies are rapidly moving to undo it. And there are going to be significant social conflicts as we see the labor market distort as a result of the transformation. 

But our basic market economy gives us the tools to do the rationing without major interference or complexity; taxation and a scheme such as UBI together create a sort of operating band for personal consumption—an operating band that will still, no doubt, contain its share of billionaires.

The second half of the trap is breaking open the resource cap. On one end that happens by getting off fossil fuels, and on the other, accessing raw materials from space. The solar system has functionally infinite quantities of every industrially or commercially useful base element available in shallow gravity wells. The tech to access those resources will probably come along in the next half century if we continue on the present course of development. Almost all of that resource extraction will *also* be automated, because robots will be able to do it better than humans.

At that point maybe you start asking even more fundamental questions about the nature of property, as the resource cap lifts you will see another gross distortion of the labor/capital interface, and probably more social conflict. 

Second half probably only happens if we navigate the first half without succumbing to civil unrest or war, or is at least delayed by a few decades (optimistically).

College educated, smart, hard workers will not be able to provide their labor for a wage. Anything those smart people can do, AI will be able to do better, cheaper, faster. That is the world that is coming. This time is different from every other previous technological and economic paradigm shift in history. The industrial revolution allowed people to move into specialized fields that opened up with that new technology and replaced human muscle with machine muscle.

But now, AI is replacing human minds. There will be no place left for humans to go. I'm quite sure there will be new kinds of jobs in the future, but increasingly those jobs will also be better suited to AI. Not literally every job, at least not in the foreseeable future, but enough that we have to do something. I see no other option than unconditional basic income. I firmly believe we have to re-frame how we think of ourselves other than how we can be productive and find value and self-worth via employment.

Its a fundamentally disruptive trend that is going to question what it means to have a productive life as a human being. What do you do when literally hundreds of millions of people are unable to find a job in a capitalistic society? Humanity has never faced something like this before. Other than free money to people, what do you do with hundreds of millions to eventually billions of people who simply cannot offer anything of value to be rewarded with from their labor? If we keep it the way things are, we're looking at orders of magnitude more income inequality. Society will not be able to withstand that.

There will be no way to make money. End-game we shouldn't even need money. The machines will be able to provide anything we want. From raw material mining to transportation, assembly and delivery. It will be the world of Star Trek. Basic income is a bridge until we reach that point.

I would not be a lazy sack of shit smoking pot all day if I had free money. Yes, some people will and I think we just have to accept that. It will be a terribly biter pill for many to swallow, but I think that's an unavoidable outcome. For me, I'd go back to school, I'd learn a new hobby, I'd travel more, have the time and energy to do what I want. AI offers humanity permanent retirement. People who are retired aren't currently making money from their labor and for the most part, they are very happy. World-wide, permanent retirement for everyone on the planet. It could free us from the drudgery of work.

I don't see a single other option, other than fighting it tooth and nail and letting society destroy itself.

So, healthcare, education, common defense, dispute resolution, energy and transportation infrastructure, communications infrastructure. I think that covers the basics for an advanced industrial state. 

I'm willing to explore other options besides tax or traditional infrastructure/service funding schemes for achieving this outcome—I think there are ways to get towards that goal in a way that feels appropriate to all involved.

Bottom line is that technology is taking us towards an economy where it is so productive that the demand for human labor is going to fall off a cliff. To some extent, we're already seeing this. We are going to have to come to some agreement about what the ""floor"" for individual status will be. We will no longer be able to make a meaningful judgement about a person's contribution to society based on employment. Because there just are no jobs for most people, it would be inappropriate to make *primary* judgment about a person's ""worth"" or value based on whether or not they have a job. 

If we do things right, it's entirely possible that in twenty or thirty years much of our basic infrastructure of resource extraction, manufacturing, food production, and transportation will require only human *supervision*, with no actual ""labor"" being performed other than monitoring the system and designing and tuning the algorithms that operate the systems. That represents a *huge* part of the labor sector.

Not everyone is going to be able to transition to high tech jobs. It's going to cause major social problems if we don't get out ahead of it.

In the long run, yes. But the Eason developing countries can benefit from tariffs is that it can grow infant industries. I said as much. Economies of scale means that by protecting a growing domestic industry can make it more competitive in the future, at which point continued tariffs do indeed harm the country. 

Again, it doesn’t help the US to impose tariffs.  Period. If the goal is retaliation, then spite seems like a shitty policy.  If the goal is to convince China to lift tariffs, there are ways to do that without hurting US consumers and other industries that rely on imports.

4854,wolverinesfire,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48238576?intlink_from_url=&link_location=live-reporting-story,"From memory, Musk heard about the Thai rescue. He had a few engineers design build and test a mini rescue capsule where 1 boy could be brought out of the cave at a time. 

The worry was that the boys might panic in the cave underwater and die. This was done in record time and was one option. 

As far as I remember, Musk also sent other equipment such as pumps/generators that did help. 

The guy musk called a pedo was a technical advisor, he did not do the dives. 

The rescue capsule may not have been used because the pumps were doing a good job of draining the water from the caves. They may or may not have been practical due to the tight geology of some sections of the cave. 

The guy initially told the news that Musk could shove his rescue capsule up his ass. 

Musk then called him a pedo. And I don't know why Musk picked pedo rather than sheep fucker. 

At least Musk put some effort, his time, his money, and the abilities of the people to work to make a difference. Go on YouTube as they test out the rescue capsule design in the pool. 

I dont think Musk is a narcissist. He gives other people credit and works his workforce to their limit. He is driven, can be good and sometimes harsh. But a narcissist only cares about their image.

Steve told Wozniak that they only earned $700, not even the base amount of money they would have received regardless of the amount of chips they had used. (The exact information he gave was that they would receive $700 for using less than 50 chips, and $1,000 for using less than 40).

I knew that Jobs was a POS at the end. But when I uncovered this information while web-walking I realized that he was *always* human garbage.

Here's the thing, people are people. Having power, be that money or just 'power' in the traditional sense tends to lower ones inhibitions and exacerbate behavior that they otherwise kept in check. It's just a natural bit of human psychology, you keep bad behaviors in check because of the consequences, but once you are at a level in the world where ALMOST every consequence is meaningless to you, then your guard just starts to slip.

Very few people are just ""genuinely nice"". Take Bill Gates as an example, he's probably the nicest billionaire I've heard of, taking all this effort to spend his money on things he thinks will help people and following generations....and yet if you know about how things went on his rise to power, you'd know that he can be ruthless.
